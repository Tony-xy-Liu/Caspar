      "Bioinformatic evaluation of L-arginine catabolic pathways in 24 cyanobacteria and transcriptional analysis of genes encoding enzymes of L-arginine catabolism in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.\n",
      "So far very limited knowledge exists on L-arginine catabolism in cyanobacteria, although six major L-arginine-degrading pathways have been described for prokaryotes. Thus, we have performed a bioinformatic analysis of possible L-arginine-degrading pathways in cyanobacteria. Further, we chose Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 for a more detailed bioinformatic analysis and for validation of the bioinformatic predictions on L-arginine catabolism with a transcript analysis.\n",
      "We have evaluated 24 cyanobacterial genomes of freshwater or marine strains for the presence of putative L-arginine-degrading enzymes. We identified an L-arginine decarboxylase pathway in all 24 strains. In addition, cyanobacteria have one or two further pathways representing either an arginase pathway or L-arginine deiminase pathway or an L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway. An L-arginine amidinotransferase pathway as a major L-arginine-degrading pathway is not likely but can not be entirely excluded. A rather unusual finding was that the cyanobacterial L-arginine deiminases are substantially larger than the enzymes in non-photosynthetic bacteria and that they are membrane-bound. A more detailed bioinformatic analysis of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 revealed that three different L-arginine-degrading pathways may in principle be functional in this cyanobacterium. These are (i) an L-arginine decarboxylase pathway, (ii) an L-arginine deiminase pathway, and (iii) an L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway. A transcript analysis of cells grown either with nitrate or L-arginine as sole N-source and with an illumination of 50 mumol photons m-2 s-1 showed that the transcripts for the first enzyme(s) of all three pathways were present, but that the transcript levels for the L-arginine deiminase and the L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase were substantially higher than that of the three isoenzymes of L-arginine decarboxylase.\n",
      "The evaluation of 24 cyanobacterial genomes revealed that five different L-arginine-degrading pathways are present in the investigated cyanobacterial species. In Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 an L-arginine deiminase pathway and an L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway represent the major pathways, while the L-arginine decarboxylase pathway most likely only functions in polyamine biosynthesis. The transcripts encoding the enzymes of the two major pathways were constitutively expressed with the exception of the transcript for the carbamate kinase, which was substantially up-regulated in cells grown with L-arginine.\n",

      "Cyanobacterial Harmful Bloom Lipopolysaccharides Induce Pro-Inflammatory Effects in Immune and Intestinal Epithelial Cells .\n",
      "Freshwater cyanobacterial harmful blooms (CyanoHABs) produce a variety of toxic and bioactive compounds including lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). The gastrointestinal tract can be exposed to them via contaminated water even during recreational activities. However, there is no evidence of an effect of CyanoHAB LPSs on intestinal cells. We isolated LPSs of four CyanoHABs dominated by different cyanobacterial species and LPSs of four laboratory cultures representing the respective dominant cyanobacterial genera. Two intestinal and one macrophage cell lines were used to detect  pro-inflammatory activity of the LPS. All LPSs isolated from CyanoHABs and laboratory cultures induced cytokines production in at least one  model, except for LPSs from the  PCC7806 culture. LPSs isolated from cyanobacteria showed unique migration patterns in SDS-PAGE that were qualitatively distinct from those of endotoxins from Gram-negative bacteria. There was no clear relationship between the biological activity of the LPS and the share of genomic DNA of Gram-negative bacteria in the respective biomass. Thus, the total share of Gram-negative bacteria, or the presence of -like LPSs, did not explain the observed pro-inflammatory activities. The pro-inflammatory properties of environmental mixtures of LPSs from CyanoHABs indicate their human health hazards, and further attention should be given to their assessment and monitoring.\n",

      "Cyanobacterial blooms pose a serious threat to public health due to the presence of cyanotoxins. Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) produced by Microcystis aeruginosa is the most common cyanotoxins. Due to the limitation of isolation, purification, and genetic manipulation techniques, it is difficult to study and verify in situ the biosynthetic pathways and molecular mechanisms of MC-LR. We reassembled the biosynthetic gene cluster (mcy cluster) of MC-LR in vitro by synthetic biology, designed and constructed the strong bidirectional promoter biPpsbA , transformed it into Synechococcus 7942, and successfully expressed MC-LR at a level of 0.006-0.018 fg cell  d . We found the expression of MC-LR led to abnormal cell division and cellular filamentation, further using various methods proved that by irreversibly competing its GTP-binding site, MC-LR inhibits assembly of the cell division protein FtsZ. The study represents the first reconstitution and expression of the mcy cluster and the autotrophic production of MC-LR in model cyanobacterium, which lays the foundation for resolving the microcystins biosynthesis pathway. The discovered role of MC-LR in cell division reveals a mechanism of how blooming cyanobacteria gain a competitive edge over their nonblooming counterparts.\n",

      "Triclosan toxicity in a model cyanobacterium (Anabaena flos-aquae): Growth, photosynthesis and transcriptomic response.\n",
      "Exposure to triclosan (TCS) has been reported to reduce photosynthetic pigments, suppress photosynthesis, and inhibit growth in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic algae including Anabaena flos-aquae (a model cyanobacterium). In particular, cyanobacteria are more sensitive to TCS toxicity compared to eukaryotic algae possibly due to the structural similarity to bacteria (target organisms); however, whether TCS exerts its toxicity to cyanobacteria by targeting signaling pathways of fatty acid biosynthesis as in bacteria remains virtually unknown, particularly at environmental exposure levels. With the complete genome sequence of A. flos-aquae presented in this study, the transcriptomic alterations and potential toxic mechanisms in A. flos-aquae under TCS stress were revealed. The growth, pigments and photosynthetic activity of A. flos-aquae were markedly suppressed following a 7-day TCS exposure at 0.5 µg/L but not 0.1 µg/L (both concentrations applied are environmentally relevant). The transcriptomic sequencing analysis showed that signaling pathways, such as biofilm formation - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two-component system, starch and sucrose metabolism, and photosynthesis were closely related to the TCS-induced growth inhibition in the 0.5 µg/L TCS treatment. Photosynthesis systems and potentially two-component system were identified to be sensitive targets of TCS toxicity in A. flos-aquae. The present study provides novel insights on TCS toxicity at the transcriptomic level in A. flos-aquae.\n",

      "An unexpected role for leucyl aminopeptidase in UV tolerance revealed by a genome-wide fitness assessment in a model cyanobacterium.\n",
      "UV radiation (UVR) has significant physiological effects on organisms living at or near the Earth's surface, yet the full suite of genes required for fitness of a photosynthetic organism in a UVR-rich environment remains unknown. This study reports a genome-wide fitness assessment of the genes that affect UVR tolerance under environmentally relevant UVR dosages in the model cyanobacterium  PCC 7942. Our results highlight the importance of specific genes that encode proteins involved in DNA repair, glutathione synthesis, and the assembly and maintenance of photosystem II, as well as genes that encode hypothetical proteins and others without an obvious connection to canonical methods of UVR tolerance. Disruption of a gene that encodes a leucyl aminopeptidase (LAP) conferred the greatest UVR-specific decrease in fitness. Enzymatic assays demonstrated a strong pH-dependent affinity of the LAP for the dipeptide cysteinyl-glycine, suggesting an involvement in glutathione catabolism as a function of night-time cytosolic pH level. A low differential expression of the LAP gene under acute UVR exposure suggests that its relative importance would be overlooked in transcript-dependent screens. Subsequent experiments revealed a similar UVR-sensitivity phenotype in LAP knockouts of other organisms, indicating conservation of the functional role of LAPs in UVR tolerance.\n",

      "Genomic insights into the biosynthesis and physiology of the cyanobacterial neurotoxin 3-N-methyl-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid (BMAA).\n",
      "Cyanobacteria are an ancient clade of photosynthetic prokaryotes, present in many habitats throughout the world, including water resources. They can present health hazards to humans and animals due to the production of a wide range of toxins (cyanotoxins), including the diaminoacid neurotoxin, 3-N-methyl-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid (β-N-methylaminoalanine, BMAA). Knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway for BMAA, and its role in cyanobacteria, is lacking. Present evidence suggests that BMAA is derived by 3-N methylation of 2,3-diaminopropanoic acid (2,3-DAP) and, although the latter has never been reported in cyanobacteria, there are multiple pathways to its biosynthesis known in other bacteria and in plants. Here, we used bioinformatics analyses to investigate hypotheses concerning 2,3-DAP and BMAA biosynthesis in cyanobacteria. We assessed the potential presence or absence of each enzyme in candidate biosynthetic routes known in Albizia julibrissin, Lathyrus sativus seedlings, Streptomyces, Clostridium, Staphylococcus aureus, Pantoea agglomerans, and Paenibacillus larvae, in 130 cyanobacterial genomes using sequence alignment, profile hidden Markov models, substrate specificity/active site identification and the reconstruction of gene phylogenies. Most enzymes involved in pathways leading to 2,3-DAP in other species were not found in the cyanobacteria analysed. Nevertheless, two species appear to have the genes sbnA and sbnB, responsible for forming the 2,3-DAP constituent in staphyloferrin B, a siderophore from Staphylococcus aureus. It is currently undetermined whether these species are also capable of biosynthesising BMAA. It is possible that, in some cyanobacteria, the formation of 2,3-DAP and/or BMAA is associated with environmental iron-scavenging. The pam gene cluster, responsible for the biosynthesis of the BMAA-containing peptide, paenilamicin, so far appears to be restricted to Paenibacillus larvae. It was not detected in any of the cyanobacterial genomes analysed, nor was it found in 93 other Paenibacillus genomes or in the genomes of two BMAA-producing diatom species. We hypothesise that the presence, in some cyanobacterial species, of the enzymes 2,3-diaminopropionate ammonia-lyase (DAPAL) and reactive intermediate deaminase A (RidA) may explain the failure to detect 2,3-DAP in analytical studies. Overall, the taxonomic distribution of 2,3-DAP and BMAA in cyanobacteria is unclear; there may be multiple and additional routes, and roles, for the biosynthesis of 2,3-DAP and BMAA in these organisms.\n",

      "The three-dimensional structure of tyrosinase has been crystallized from many species but not from Homo sapiens. Tyrosinase is a key enzyme in melanin biosynthesis, being an important target for melanoma and skin-whitening cosmetics. Several studies employed the structure of tyrosinase from  as a model enzyme. Recently, 98% of human genome proteins were elucidated by AlphaFold. Herein, the AlphaFold structure of human tyrosinase and the previous model were compared. Moreover, tyrosinase-related proteins 1 and 2 were included, along with inhibition studies employing kojic and cinnamic acids. Peptides are widely studied for their inhibitory activity of skin-related enzymes. Cyanophycin is an amino acid polymer produced by cyanobacteria and is built of aspartic acid and arginine; arginine can be also replaced by other amino acids. A new set of cyanophycin-derived dipeptides was evaluated as potential inhibitors. Aspartate-glutamate showed the strongest interaction and was chosen as a leading compound for future studies.\n",

      "Integrative analysis of the salt stress response in cyanobacteria.\n",
      "Microorganisms evolved specific acclimation strategies to thrive in environments of high or fluctuating salinities. Here, salt acclimation in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was analyzed by integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data. A dynamic reorganization of the transcriptome occurred during the first hours after salt shock, e.g. involving the upregulation of genes to activate compatible solute biochemistry balancing osmotic pressure. The massive accumulation of glucosylglycerol then had a measurable impact on the overall carbon and nitrogen metabolism. In addition, we observed the coordinated induction of putative regulatory RNAs and of several proteins known for their involvement in other stress responses. Overall, salt-induced changes in the proteome and transcriptome showed good correlations, especially among the stably up-regulated proteins and their transcripts. We define an extended salt stimulon comprising proteins directly or indirectly related to compatible solute metabolism, ion and water movements, and a distinct set of regulatory RNAs involved in post-transcriptional regulation. Our comprehensive data set provides the basis for engineering cyanobacterial salt tolerance and to further understand its regulation.\n",

      "Conserved Two-component Hik2-Rre1 Signaling Is Activated Under Temperature Upshift and Plastoquinone-reducing Conditions in the Cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942.\n",
      "The highly conserved Hik2-Rre1 two-component system is a multi-stress responsive signal-transducing module that controls the expression of hsp and other genes in cyanobacteria. Previously, we found in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 that the heat-inducible phosphorylation of Rre1 was alleviated in a hik34 mutant, suggesting that Hik34 positively regulates signaling. In this study, we examined the growth of the hik34 deletion mutant in detail, and newly identified suppressor mutations located in rre1 or sasA gene negating the phenotype. Subsequent analyses indicated that heat-inducible Rre1 phosphorylation is dependent on Hik2 and that Hik34 modulates this Hik2-dependent response. In the following part of this study, we focused on the mechanism to control the Hik2 activity. Other recent studies reported that Hik2 activity is regulated by the redox status of plastoquinone (PQ) through the 3Fe-4S cluster attached to the cyclic GMP, adenylyl cyclase, FhlA (GAF) domain. Consistent with this, Rre1 phosphorylation occurred after the addition of 2,5-dibromo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone but not after the addition of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea to the culture medium, which corresponded to PQ-reducing or -oxidizing conditions, respectively, suggesting that the Hik2-to-Rre1 phosphotransfer was activated under PQ-reducing conditions. However, there was no correlation between the measured PQ redox status and Rre1 phosphorylation during the temperature upshift. Therefore, changes in the PQ redox status are not the direct reason for the heat-inducible Rre1 phosphorylation, while some redox regulation is likely involved as oxidation events dependent on 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone prevented heat-inducible Rre1 phosphorylation. On the basis of these results, we propose a model for the control of Hik2-dependent Rre1 phosphorylation.\n",

      "Probing the metabolism of γ-glutamyl peptides in cyanobacteria via metabolite profiling and  C labeling.\n",
      "Cyanobacteria are attractive model organisms for the study of photosynthesis and diurnal metabolism and as hosts for photoautotrophic production of chemicals. Exposure to bright light or environmental pollutants and a diurnal lifestyle of these prokaryotes may result in significant oxidative stress. Glutathione is a widely studied γ-glutamyl peptide that plays a key role in managing oxidative stress and detoxification of xenobiotics in cyanobacteria. The functional role and biosynthesis pathways of this tripeptide have been studied in detail in various phyla, including cyanobacteria. However, other γ-glutamyl peptides remain largely unexplored. We use an integrated approach to identify a number of γ-glutamyl peptides based on signature mass fragments and mass shifts in them in  C and  N enriched metabolite extracts. The newly identified compounds include γ-glutamyl dipeptides and derivatives of glutathione. Carbon backbones of the former turn over much faster than that of glutathione, suggesting that they follow a distinct biosynthesis pathway. Further, transients of isotopic  C enrichment show positional labeling in these peptides, which allows us to delineate the alternative biosynthesis pathways. Importantly, the amino acid of γ-glutamyl dipeptides shows much faster turnover compared to the glutamate moiety. The significant accumulation of γ-glutamyl dipeptides under slow-growth conditions combined with the results from dynamic  C labeling suggests that these compounds may act as reservoirs of amino acids in cyanobacteria.\n",

      "Cyanobacteria are an ancient clade of photosynthetic prokaryotes, whose worldwide occurrence, especially in water, presents health hazards to humans and animals due to the production of a range of toxins (cyanotoxins). These include the sometimes co-occurring, non-encoded diaminoacid neurotoxins 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid (2,4-DAB) and its structural analogue β-N-methylaminoalanine (BMAA). Knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway for 2,4-DAB, and its role in cyanobacteria, is lacking. The aspartate 4-phosphate pathway is a known route of 2,4-DAB biosynthesis in other bacteria and in some plant species. Another pathway to 2,4-DAB has been described in Lathyrus species. Here, we use bioinformatics analyses to investigate hypotheses concerning 2,4-DAB biosynthesis in cyanobacteria. We assessed the presence or absence of each enzyme in candidate biosynthesis routes, the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway and a pathway to 2,4-DAB derived from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), in 130 cyanobacterial genomes using sequence alignment, profile hidden Markov models, substrate specificity/active site identification and the reconstruction of gene phylogenies. In the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway, for the 18 species encoding diaminobutanoate-2-oxo-glutarate transaminase, the co-localisation of genes encoding the transaminase with the downstream decarboxylase or ectoine synthase - often within hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-polyketide synthases (PKS) clusters, NRPS-independent siderophore (NIS) clusters and incomplete ectoine clusters - is compatible with the hypothesis that some cyanobacteria use the aspartate 4-phosphate pathway for 2,4-DAB production. Through this route, in cyanobacteria, 2,4-DAB may be functionally associated with environmental iron-scavenging, via the production of siderophores of the schizokinen/synechobactin type and of some polyamines. In the pathway to 2,4-DAB derived from SAM, eight cyanobacterial species encode homologs of SAM-dependent 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl transferases. Other enzymes in this pathway have not yet been purified or sequenced. Ultimately, the biosynthesis of 2,4-DAB appears to be either restricted to some cyanobacterial species, or there may be multiple and additional routes, and roles, for the synthesis of this neurotoxin.\n",

      "Evolution and function of glutathione S-transferase (GST) in primordial oxygenic phototrophs such as cyanobacteria are poorly understood. In this study, we identified and functionally characterized the GST gene family in the halotolerant cyanobacterium Halothece sp. PCC7418. Four putative Halothece-GSTs had very low homology, which implies evolutionary divergence. Of these, H0647, H0729 and H3557 were differentially expressed by oxidative stress whereas H3557 was highly and specifically upregulated under salt stress. In vitro analysis revealed that the recombinant H3557 exhibited GST activity toward 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and glutathione (GSH). H3557 displayed a broad range of activity at pH 6.5-10.5. Kinetic parameters showed the apparent K for CDNB and GSH was 0.14 and 0.75 mM, respectively. H3557 remained catalytically active in the presence of NaCl. Structural modelling supported that H3557 is salt-adaptive enzyme with highly acidic residues on the protein surface. The vital function of H3557 in heterologous expression system was evaluated. The H3557-expressing cells were more tolerant to H O -induced oxidative stress compared with other GST-expressing cells and conferred salt tolerance. Taken together, the findings of this study provide insights into the molecular and cellular functions of GST in cyanobacteria, particularly under salt stress, which is less understood compared with other species.\n",

      "Cyanobacterial blooms constitute a global ecological problem that can seriously threaten human health. One of the most common bloom-forming cyanobacteria in freshwater is Microcystis aeruginosa, whose secretion of toxic substances (microcystins, MCs) have strong liver toxicity and endanger the health of exposed people through contaminated aquatic products and drinking water. However, few studies on the neurotoxicity of M. aeruginosa to zebrafish have simulated the process of an actual cyanobacterial bloom. In this study, we used the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an effective model organism to study the acute neurotoxicity of M. aeruginosa, and to clarify its principal mechanism of action. A total of 82 upregulated and 26 downregulated proteins were detected by quantitative proteomics analysis in zebrafish brain after exposure to M. aeruginosa. Intriguingly, these proteins with changed expression were related to Synaptic vesicle cycle and terpenoid skeleton biosynthesis pathway, such as ACAT, STX1A, and V-ATPase. The obtained results uniformly indicated that the neurotoxicity of M. aeruginosa seriously damaged the neurotransmitter conduction in the nervous system and brain information storage and transmission of zebrafish and makes it more susceptible to neurological diseases. Our study provides a new perspective on the neurotoxicity risk of cyanobacterial blooms.\n",

      "Microcystin-LR (MCY-LR) is a heptapeptide toxin produced mainly by freshwater cyanobacteria. It strongly inhibits protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1. Functioning of the PIN family of auxin efflux carriers is crucial for plant ontogenesis and their functions depend on their reversible phosphorylation. We aimed to reveal the adverse effects of MCY-LR on PIN and auxin distribution in Arabidopsis roots and its consequences for root development. Relatively short-term (24 h) MCY-LR treatments decreased the levels of PIN1, PIN2 and PIN7, but not of PIN3 in tips of primary roots. In contrast, levels of PIN1 and PIN2 increased in emergent lateral roots and their levels depended on the type of PIN in lateral root primordia. DR5:GFP reporter activity showed that the cyanotoxin-induced decrease of auxin levels/responses in tips of main roots in parallel to PIN levels. Those alterations did not affect gravitropic response of roots. However, MCY-LR complemented the altered gravitropic response of crk5-1 mutants, defective in a protein kinase with essential role in the correct membrane localization of PIN2. For MCY-LR treated Col-0 plants, the number of lateral root primordia but not of emergent laterals increased and lateral root primordia showed early development. In conclusion, inhibition of protein phosphatase activities changed PIN and auxin levels, thus altered root development. Previous data on aquatic plants naturally co-occurring with the cyanotoxin showed similar alterations of root development. Thus, our results on the model plant Arabidopsis give a mechanistic explanation of MCY-LR phytotoxicity in aquatic ecosystems.\n",

      "Amino Acid Analog Induces Stress Response in Marine .\n",
      "Characterizing the cell-level metabolic trade-offs that phytoplankton exhibit in response to changing environmental conditions is important for predicting the impact of these changes on marine food web dynamics and biogeochemical cycling. The time-selective proteome-labeling approach, bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), has potential to provide insight into differential allocation of resources at the cellular level, especially when coupled with proteomics. However, the application of this technique in marine phytoplankton remains limited. We demonstrate that the marine cyanobacteria  sp. and two groups of eukaryotic algae take up the modified amino acid l-homopropargylglycine (HPG), suggesting that BONCAT can be used to detect translationally active phytoplankton. However, the impact of HPG addition on growth dynamics varied between groups of phytoplankton. In addition, proteomic analysis of  cells grown with HPG revealed a physiological shift in nitrogen metabolism, general protein stress, and energy production, indicating a potential limitation for the use of BONCAT in understanding the cell-level response of  sp. to environmental change. Variability in HPG sensitivity between algal groups and the impact of HPG on  physiology indicates that particular considerations should be taken when applying this technique to other marine taxa or mixed marine microbial communities.  Phytoplankton form the base of the marine food web and substantially impact global energy and nutrient flow. Marine picocyanobacteria of the genus  comprise a large portion of phytoplankton biomass in the ocean and therefore are important model organisms. The technical challenges of environmental proteomics in mixed microbial communities have limited our ability to detect the cell-level adaptations of phytoplankton communities to a changing environment. The proteome labeling technique, bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), has potential to address some of these challenges by simplifying proteomic analyses. This study explores the ability of marine phytoplankton to take up the modified amino acid, l-homopropargylglycine (HPG), required for BONCAT, and investigates the proteomic response of  to HPG. We not only demonstrate that cyanobacteria can take up HPG but also highlight the physiological impact of HPG on , which has implications for future applications of this technique in the marine environment.\n",

      "Exposure to toxins produced by cyanobacteria (ie, cyanotoxins) is an emerging health concern due to their increasing prevalence and previous associations with neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the neurotoxic effects of a mixture of two co-occurring cyanotoxins, β-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) and microcystin leucine and arginine (MCLR), using the larval zebrafish model. We combined high-throughput behavior-based toxicity assays with discovery proteomic techniques to identify behavioral and molecular changes following 6 days of exposure. Although neither toxin caused mortality, morphological defects, nor altered general locomotor behavior in zebrafish larvae, both toxins increased acoustic startle sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner by at least 40% (p < .0001). Furthermore, startle sensitivity was enhanced by an additional 40% in larvae exposed to the BMAA/MCLR mixture relative to those exposed to the individual toxins. Supporting these behavioral results, our proteomic analysis revealed a 4-fold increase in the number of differentially expressed proteins in the mixture-exposed group. Additionally, prediction analysis reveals activation and/or inhibition of 8 enriched canonical pathways (enrichment p-value < .01; z-score≥|2|), including ILK, Rho Family GTPase, RhoGDI, and calcium signaling pathways, which have been implicated in neurodegeneration. We also found that expression of TDP-43, of which cytoplasmic aggregates are a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathology, was significantly upregulated by 5.7-fold following BMAA/MCLR mixture exposure. Together, our results emphasize the importance of including mixtures of cyanotoxins when investigating the link between environmental cyanotoxins and neurodegeneration as we reveal that BMAA and MCLR interact in vivo to enhance neurotoxicity.\n",

      "Post-translational Modifications of Serine/Threonine and Histidine Kinases and Their Roles in Signal Transductions in Synechocystis Sp. PCC 6803.\n",
      "Cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a popular model organism for researches in photosynthesis and biofuel production, contains plant-like photosynthetic machineries which significantly contribute to global carbon fixation. There are 12 eukaryotic-type Ser/Thr kinases (SpkA-L) and 49 His kinases (Hik1-49) of two-component systems in the genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. They are the key regulators in sensing and transmitting stimuli including light- and glucose-mediate signal transduction. Proteomic studies were able to identify all the kinases. The majority of kinases no matter whether they have a predicted transmembrane domain were identified in the membrane fractions. Six Ser/Thr kinases (SpkA-D, F and G) and ten His kinases (Hik4, 12, 14, 21, 26-27, 29, 36, 43, and 46) were identified to have one or more of the three types of post-translational modifications: phosphorylation, acetylation, and thiol oxidation. Interestingly, SpkG has the phosphorylatable threonine residue that was aligned with the phosphorylated threonine residue in the activation loop of human CDK7, demonstrating conserved phosphorylation between cyanobacterial and human kinases. Transcriptomics and proteomics revealed differential expression of the kinases in heterotrophic and photoheterotrophic compared with photoautotrophic conditions, indicating their roles in regulating the growth modes of cyanobacteria. In summary, this review focuses on the discussions on post-transcriptional modifications, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies of Ser/Thr and His kinases. This together with our published review in 2019 present a complete story of an overview of sequences, domain architectures, and biochemical and physiological functions of cyanobacterial kinases with adequate details in the context of high throughput systems. We also emphasize the importance of discovering upstream molecules and substrates to understand the exact functions of the kinases in vivo. As an attempt, a model is proposed in which Hik31, His33, Sll1334, and IcfG are hypothesized to be critical for switching between autotrophic and heterotrophic modes based on the results from the phenotypes of the gene knockout strains combined with their post-translational modifications, and gene expression profiles.\n",

      "New Insights in  Response to the Cyanotoxin Microcystin-LR, Revealed by Proteomics and Gene Expression.\n",
      "Microcystins (MCs) are hepatotoxins produced by some cyanobacteria. They are cyclic peptides that inhibit the serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PPs) PP1 and PP2A, especially PP2A. The inhibition of PP2A triggers a series of molecular events, which are responsible for most MC cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on animal cells. It is also known that MCs induce oxidative stress in cells due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, a complete characterization of the toxic effects of MCs is still not accomplished. This study aimed to clarify additional molecular mechanisms involved in MC-LR toxicity, using  as eukaryotic model organism. First, a shotgun proteomic analysis of  VL3 cells response to 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, and 1 µM MC-LR was undertaken and compared to the control (cells not exposed to MC-LR). This analysis revealed a high number of proteins differentially expressed related with gene translation and DNA replication stress; oxidative stress; cell cycle regulation and carbohydrate metabolism. Inference of genotoxic effects of  VL3 cells exposed to different concentrations of MC-LR were evaluated by analyzing the expression of genes , , ,  and  (from the Base Excision Repair (BER) DNA repair system) using the Real-Time RT-qPCR technique. These genes displayed alterations after exposure to MC-LR, particularly the //, pointing out effects of MC-LR in the Base Excision Repair system (BER). Overall, this study supports the role of oxidative stress and DNA replication stress as important molecular mechanisms of MC-LR toxicity. Moreover, this study showed that even at low-concentration, MC-LR can induce significant changes in the yeast proteome and in gene expression.\n",

      "The Proposed Neurotoxin β--Methylamino-l-Alanine (BMAA) Is Taken up through Amino-Acid Transport Systems in the Cyanobacterium  PCC 7120.\n",
      "Produced by cyanobacteria and some plants, BMAA is considered as an important environmental factor in the occurrence of some neurodegenerative diseases. Neither the underlying mechanism of its toxicity, nor its biosynthetic or metabolic pathway in cyanobacteria is understood. Interestingly, BMAA is found to be toxic to some cyanobacteria, making it possible to dissect the mechanism of BMAA metabolism by genetic approaches using these organisms. In this study, we used the cyanobacterium  PCC 7120 to isolate BMAA-resistant mutants. Following genomic sequencing, several mutations were mapped to two genes involved in amino acids transport, suggesting that BMAA was taken up through amino acid transporters. This conclusion was supported by the protective effect of several amino acids against BMAA toxicity. Furthermore, targeted inactivation of genes encoding different amino acid transport pathways conferred various levels of resistance to BMAA. One mutant inactivating all three major amino acid transport systems could no longer take up BMAA and gained full resistance to BMAA toxicity. Therefore, BMAA is a substrate of amino acid transporters, and cyanobacteria are interesting models for genetic analysis of BMAA transport and metabolism.\n",

      "Evaluation of the Potential Risk of Advanced Peak Determination in Distorting Isobaric Labeling-Based Single-Shot Proteome Quantitation.\n",
      "The recent development and implementation of the advanced peak determination (APD) algorithm with MS instrument dramatically increased the sampling of low abundance features for MS/MS fragmentation. After in-depth evaluation, it is found that with APD on, many chimeric spectra are acquired through co-fragmentation of high abundance contaminants with low abundance targets, and such co-fragmentations are largely avoided when APD is off. To evaluate whether such a co-fragmentation could significantly distort the accuracy of the isobaric-labeling based quantitation of the low abundance target, a single-shot TMT experiment is performed using a two-proteome model, whereby each TMT channel contains premixed peptides from human and a cyanobacterium with a known ratio. Unexpectedly, it is found that APD does not significantly distort TMT ratios, probably because the majority of the APD-specific chimeric spectra are not identifiable. Nevertheless, a few examples of significant distortion of TMT ratios of low abundance peptides caused by APD is found through manual inspection, and suggests that APD should be off in a single-shot TMT experiment to avoid the laborious and time-costing manual inspection.\n",

      "While the model bacteria  and  harbor single chromosomes, which is known as monoploidy, some freshwater cyanobacteria contain multiple chromosome copies per cell throughout their cell cycle, which is known as polyploidy. In the model cyanobacteria  PCC 7942 and  sp. PCC 6803, chromosome copy number (ploidy) is regulated in response to growth phase and environmental factors. In  7942, chromosome replication is asynchronous both among cells and chromosomes. Comparative analysis of  7942 and . sp. 6803 revealed a variety of DNA replication mechanisms. In this review, the current knowledge of ploidy and DNA replication mechanisms in cyanobacteria is summarized together with information on the features common with plant chloroplasts. It is worth noting that the occurrence of polyploidy and its regulation are correlated with certain cyanobacterial lifestyles and are shared between some cyanobacteria and chloroplasts.\n",

      "Dolichospermum circinale is a filamentous bloom-forming cyanobacterium responsible for biosynthesis of the paralytic shellfish toxins (PST), including saxitoxin. PSTs are neurotoxins and in their purified form are important analytical standards for monitoring the quality of water and seafood and biomedical research tools for studying neuronal sodium channels. More recently, PSTs have been recognised for their utility as local anaesthetics. Characterisation of the transcriptional elements within the saxitoxin (sxt) biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) is a first step towards accessing these molecules for biotechnology.\n",
      "In D. circinale AWQC131C the sxt BGC is transcribed from two bidirectional promoter regions encoding five individual promoters. These promoters were identified experimentally using 5' RACE and their activity assessed via coupling to a lux reporter system in E. coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Transcription of the predicted drug/metabolite transporter (DMT) encoded by sxtPER was found to initiate from two promoters, PsxtPER1 and PsxtPER2. In E. coli, strong expression of lux from PsxtP, PsxtD and PsxtPER1 was observed while expression from Porf24 and PsxtPER2 was remarkably weaker. In contrast, heterologous expression in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 showed that expression of lux from PsxtP, PsxtPER1, and Porf24 promoters was statistically higher compared to the non-promoter control, while PsxtD showed poor activity under the described conditions.\n",
      "Both of the heterologous hosts investigated in this study exhibited high expression levels from three of the five sxt promoters. These results indicate that the majority of the native sxt promoters appear active in different heterologous hosts, simplifying initial cloning efforts. Therefore, heterologous expression of the sxt BGC in either E. coli or Synechocystis could be a viable first option for producing PSTs for industrial or biomedical purposes.\n",

      "Nutritional quality of phytoplankton is a major determinant of the trophic transfer efficiency at the plant-herbivore interface in freshwater food webs. In particular, the phytoplankton's content of the essential polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has been repeatedly shown to limit secondary production in the major zooplankton herbivore genus Daphnia. Despite extensive research efforts on the biological model organism Daphnia, and the availability of several Daphnia genomes, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the limitations in Daphnia related to dietary EPA availability.\n",
      "We used RNA-seq to analyse the transcriptomic response of Daphnia magna which were fed with two different diets - each with or without supplementation of EPA - at two different temperature levels (15 and 20 °C). The transcripts were mapped to the D. magna genome assembly version 2.4, containing 26,646 translations. When D. magna fed on green alga, changing the temperature provoked a differential expression of 2001 transcripts, and in cyanobacteria-fed daphnia, 3385 transcripts were affected. The supplementation of EPA affected 1635 (on the green algal diet), or 175 transcripts (on the cyanobacterial diet), respectively. Combined effects for diet and temperature were also observed (669 for the green algal and 128 transcripts for the cyanobacterial diet). Searching for orthologous genes (COG-analysis) yielded a functional overview of the altered transcriptomes. Cross-matched transcript sets from both feed types were compiled to illuminate core responses to the factors temperature and EPA-supplementation.\n",
      "Our highly controlled eco-physiological experiments revealed an orchestrated response of genes involved in the transformation and signalling of essential fatty acids, including eicosanoid-signalling pathways with potential immune functions. We provide an overview of downstream-regulated genes, which contribute to enhance growth and reproductive output. We also identified numerous EPA-responsive candidate genes of yet unknown function, which constitute new targets for future studies on the molecular basis of EPA-dependent effects at the freshwater plant-herbivore interface.\n",

      "Cyanobacteria Respond to Low Levels of Ethylene.\n",
      "Ethylene is a gas that has long been known to act as a plant hormone. We recently showed that a cyanobacterium,  sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis) contains an ethylene receptor (SynEtr1) that regulates cell surface and extracellular components leading to altered phototaxis and biofilm formation. To determine whether other cyanobacteria respond to ethylene, we examined the effects of exogenous ethylene on phototaxis of the filamentous cyanobacterium,  sp. PCC 7105 (Geitlerinema). A search of the Geitlerinema genome suggests that two genes encode proteins that contain an ethylene binding domain and Geitlerinema cells have previously been shown to bind ethylene. We call these genes  and  and show that in air both are expressed. Treatment with ethylene decreases the abundance of  transcripts. Treatment of Geitlerinema with 1000 nL L ethylene affected the phototaxis response to white light as well as monochromatic red light, but not blue or green light. This is in contrast to Synechocystis where we previously found ethylene affected phototaxis to all three colors. We also demonstrate that application of ethylene down to 8 nL L stimulates phototaxis of both cyanobacteria as well as biofilm formation of Synechocystis. We formerly demonstrated that the transcript levels of  and  in Synechocystis are reduced by treatment with 1000 nL L ethylene. Here we show that application of ethylene down to 1 nL L causes a reduction in  abundance. This is below the threshold for most ethylene responses documented in plants. By contrast,  is unaffected by this low level of ethylene and only shows a reduction in transcript abundance at the highest ethylene level used. Thus, cyanobacteria are very sensitive to ethylene. However, the dose-binding characteristics of ethylene binding to Geitlerinema and Synechocystis cells as well as to the ethylene binding domain of SynEtr1 heterologously expressed in yeast, are similar to what has been reported for plants and exogenously expressed ethylene receptors from plants. These data are consistent with a model where signal amplification is occurring at the level of the receptors.\n",

      "Proteomic De-Regulation in Cyanobacteria in Response to Abiotic Stresses.\n",
      "Cyanobacteria are oxygenic photoautotrophs, exhibiting a cosmopolitan distribution in almost all possible environments and are significantly responsible for half of the global net primary productivity. They are well adapted to the diverse environments including harsh conditions by evolving a range of fascinating repertoires of unique biomolecules and secondary metabolites to support their growth and survival. These phototrophs are proved as excellent models for unraveling the mysteries of basic biochemical and physiological processes taking place in higher plants. Several known species of cyanobacteria have tremendous biotechnological applications in diverse fields such as biofuels, biopolymers, secondary metabolites and much more. Due to their potential biotechnological and commercial applications in various fields, there is an imperative need to engineer robust cyanobacteria in such a way that they can tolerate and acclimatize to ever-changing environmental conditions. Adaptations to stress are mainly governed by a precise gene regulation pathways resulting in the expression of novel protein/enzymes and metabolites. Despite the demand, till date few proteins/enzymes have been identified which play a potential role in improving tolerance against abiotic stresses. Therefore, it is utmost important to study environmental stress responses related to post-genomic investigations, including proteomic changes employing advanced proteomics, synthetic and structural biology workflows. In this respect, the study of stress proteomics offers exclusive advantages to scientists working on these aspects. Advancements on these fields could be helpful in dissecting, characterization and manipulation of physiological and metabolic systems of cyanobacteria to understand the stress induced proteomic responses. Till date, it remains ambiguous how cyanobacteria perceive changes in the ambient environment that lead to the stress-induced proteins thus metabolic deregulation. This review briefly describes the current major findings in the fields of proteome research on the cyanobacteria under various abiotic stresses. These findings may improve and advance the information on the role of different class of proteins associated with the mechanism(s) of stress mitigation in cyanobacteria under harsh environmental conditions.\n",

      "High Yield of Bioactive Abietane Diterpenes in Salvia sclarea Hairy Roots by Overexpressing Cyanobacterial DXS or DXR Genes.\n",
      "Abietane diterpenoids, containing a quinone moiety, are synthesized in the roots of several  species. Promising cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activities have been reported for these compounds in various cell and animal models. We have recently shown that aethiopinone, an o-naphto-quinone diterpene, produced in the roots of different  species, is selectively cytotoxic against the A375 melanoma cell line. To enhance the synthesis of this abietane diterpenoid, we have engineered the plastidial 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate-derived isoprenoid pathway in  hairy roots by ectopic expression and plastid targeting of cyanobacterial genes encoding the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase or 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase gene, the first two enzymatic steps of the plastidial MEP pathway, from which plant diterpenes primarily derive. Plastid-targeted expression of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase proteins significantly enhanced the yield of aethiopinone by a 3-fold and about 6-fold increase, respectively. The accumulation of other abietane-type diterpenes (ferruginol, salvipisone, and carnosic acid), with interesting antiproliferative activity, was also increased. Compared to our previous data obtained by overexpressing the plant orthologous 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase genes in  hairy roots, the results presented here confirm that the bacterial 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase enzyme plays a major role than the DXS enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of this class of compounds and that its ectopic expression does not conflict with active hairy root growth, resulting in a balanced trade-off between the transgenic hairy root final biomass and the increased content of o-naphto-quinone diterpenes, with interesting biological activities.\n",

      "Desert cyanobacteria prepare in advance for dehydration and rewetting: The role of light and temperature sensing.\n",
      "Cyanobacteria inhabiting desert biological soil crusts must prepare towards dehydration, or their revival after rewetting is severely impaired. The mechanisms involved are unknown but signalling of forthcoming dehydration by dawn illumination was demonstrated. Accurate and reproducible simulation of desert conditions enabled examination of physiological activities and transcript profiles in a model organism, Leptolyngbya ohadii, in response to specific conditions. Exposure to far red light or lack of ground warming during dawn severely reduced revival after rewetting and altered the network of gene expression. The data implicated phytochromes in light and temperature sensing. Many genes were up- or down-regulated before water content decline, while others were strongly affected by the progression of dehydration and desiccation. Transcription continues during the desiccated phase but only barely during early rewetting, although photosynthetic activity was regained. Application of rifampicin with or without a preceding dehydration phase demonstrated that RNA is stabilized/protected during desiccation, possibly by intrinsically disordered proteins. We conclude that increasing light and temperature at dawn activates a network of genes that prepare the cells towards dehydration. Quick resumption of photosynthesis upon rewetting in contrast to the slow change in the transcript profile suggested that in addition to preparing towards dehydration the cells also prepare for forthcoming rewetting, during dehydration. Unravelling the presently unknown function of many responding genes will help to clarify the networks involved.\n",

      "Coordination of Polyploid Chromosome Replication with Cell Size and Growth in a Cyanobacterium.\n",
      "Homologous chromosome number (ploidy) has diversified among bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes over evolution. In bacteria, model organisms such as  possess a single chromosome encoding the entire genome during slow growth. In contrast, other bacteria, including cyanobacteria, maintain multiple copies of individual chromosomes (polyploid). Although a correlation between ploidy level and cell size has been observed in bacteria and eukaryotes, it is poorly understood how replication of multicopy chromosomes is regulated and how ploidy level is adjusted to cell size. In addition, the advantages conferred by polyploidy are largely unknown. Here we show that only one or a few multicopy chromosomes are replicated at once in the cyanobacterium  and that this restriction depends on regulation of DnaA activity. Inhibiting the DnaA intrinsic ATPase activity in  increased the number of replicating chromosomes and chromosome number per cell but did not affect cell growth. In contrast, when cell growth rate was increased or decreased, DnaA level, DnaA activity, and the number of replicating chromosomes also increased or decreased in parallel, resulting in nearly constant chromosome copy number per unit of cell volume at constant temperature. When chromosome copy number was increased by inhibition of DnaA ATPase activity or reduced culture temperature, cells exhibited greater resistance to UV light. Thus, it is suggested that the stepwise replication of the genome enables cyanobacteria to maintain nearly constant gene copy number per unit of cell volume and that multicopy chromosomes function as backup genetic information to compensate for genomic damage. Polyploidy has evolved many times across the kingdom of life. The relationship between cell growth and chromosome replication in bacteria has been studied extensively in monoploid model organisms such as  but not in polyploid organisms. Our study of the polyploid cyanobacterium  demonstrates that replicating chromosome number is restricted and regulated by DnaA to maintain a relatively stable gene copy number/cell volume ratio during cell growth. In addition, our results suggest that polyploidy confers resistance to UV, which damages DNA. This compensatory polyploidy is likely necessitated by photosynthesis, which requires sunlight and generates damaging reactive oxygen species, and may also explain how polyploid bacteria can adapt to extreme environments with high risk of DNA damage.\n",

      "The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis) is a photoautotrophic prokaryote with plant-like photosynthetic machineries which significantly contribute to global carbon fixation and atmospheric oxygen production. Because of the relatively short cell doubling time, small size of the genome, and the ease for genetic manipulation, Synechocystis is a popular model organism for studies including photosynthesis and biofuel production. The cyanobacterium contains 12 eukaryotic type Ser/Thr kinases (SpkA-L) and 49 histidine kinases (Hik1-47 and Sll1334 and Sll5060 are named as Hik48 and Hik49, respectively, in this review) of the two-component system. All SpkA-L kinases have a eukaryotic kinase DFG signature in their A-loops. Based on the types of the kinase domains, the Spks can be separated into three groups: one group contains SpkA and SpkG which are related to human kinases, while SpkH-L are in another group that is distinct from human kinases. The third group contains SpkB-F which are between the first two groups. Four histidine kinases (Hiks17, 36, 45, and 48) lack a clear histidine kinase domain, and the conserved phosphorylatable histidine residue could not be identified for six histidine kinases (Hiks11, 18, 29, 37, 39, and 43) even though they have clear histidine kinase domains. Each of the remaining 39 has a histidine kinase domain with the conserved histidine residue. Eight hybrid histidine kinases contain one or two receiver domains, and they all, except Hik25 (Slr0222), have the conserved phosphorylatable aspartate. The disruptants of all kinases except hik13 and hik15 have been generated, and the majority of them have modest or no obvious phenotypes, indicating other kinases could functionally compensate the loss of a particular kinase. This review presents a comprehensive discussion including a spectrum of sequence, domain architecture, in vivo function, and proteomics investigations of Ser/Thr and histidine kinases. Understanding the sequences, domain architectures, and biology of the kinases will help to integrate \"omic\" data to clarify their exact biochemical functions.\n",

We show that DEREPLICATOR+ can search all spectra in the recently launched Global Natural Products Social molecular network and identify an order of magnitude more natural products than previous dereplication efforts.

      "To adapt to xeric environments, microorganisms have evolved with the capability of the superior desiccation tolerance and rapid resuscitation after rehydration. Nostoc flagelliforme, a representative terrestrial cyanobacterium that is distributed in west and west-northern parts of China, serves as an ideal model for gaining insight in the physiological recovery mechanism. In this study, LC-MS/MS combined with isobaric chemical labeling technique (iTRAQ) was used to quantify dynamic changes of proteins in N. flagelliforme during the rehydration processes. Approximately 113 proteins were identified to be differentially expressed, with function mainly related to photosynthesis, defense response, biosynthesis, antioxidant system, and energy and carbohydrate metabolism. Among them, protective proteins including high light inducible proteins and antioxidants showed a down regulation trend during the rehydration process, while proteins involved in photosynthesis, biosynthesis and signaling pathways and regulation of gene expression tend to be up-regulated. These results might shed light on molecular mechanism for the N.flagelliforme response to hydration. SIGNIFICANCE: In this work, iTRAQ-based proteome expression profiling provides a holistic proteomic insight for N. flagelliforme in response to rehydration processes. Proteins involved in defense system could help to limit the damage to a repairable level and maintain cellular physiological integrity in the dried state. In addition, results in this work suggest that changes in expression of light-harvesting complexes phycobilisome is closely related to the switch of photosynthesis apparatus, while only a few proteins in PSI and PSII present significant expression change, which may indicate the integrity of PSI and PSII photosynthetic system.\n",

Using a comprehensive biochemical, proteomic and stoichiometric profiling of biomass, this study demonstrated that the proposed cultivation approach could increase the proteins and pigments yields by 20-30%, compared to the respective yields obtained from wild-type Arthrospira sp. strain A light-energy-transfer model was used to predict the biomass and oxygen productivities of Arthrospira sp. cultivated under transitional-feeding regime. 95 ± 2% match was observed between the experimental and simulated productivities.

      "Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation are well known as connected with many important biological processes. Rapid accumulating evidence shows environmental stress can generate particular defense epigenetic changes across generations in eukaryotes. This transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in animals and plants has gained interest over the last years. Cyanobacteria play very crucial role in the earth, and as the primary producer they can adapt to nearly all diverse environments. However, few knowledge about the genome wide epigenetic information such as methylome information in cyanobacteria, especially under any environment stress, was reported so far. In this study we profiled the genome-wide cytosine methylation from a model cyanobacterium  sp. PCC 6803, and explored the possibility of transgenerational epigenetic process in this ancient single-celled prokaryote by comparing the DNA methylomes among normal nitrogen medium cultivation, nitrogen starvation for 72 h and nitrogen recovery for about 12 generations. Our results shows that DNA methylation patterns in nitrogen starvation and nitrogen recovery are much more similar with each other, significantly different from that of the normal nitrogen. This study reveals the difference in global DNA methylation pattern of cyanobacteria between normal and nutrient stress conditions and reports the evidence of transgenerational epigenetic process in cyanobacteria. The results of this study may contribute to a better understanding of epigenetic regulation in prokaryotic adaptation to and survive in the ever changing environment.\n",

      "Cyanobacteria that do not fix atmospheric nitrogen gas survive prolonged periods of nitrogen starvation in a chlorotic, dormant state where cell growth and metabolism are arrested. Upon nutrient availability, these dormant cells return to vegetative growth within 2-3 days. This resuscitation process is highly orchestrated and relies on the stepwise reinstallation and activation of essential cellular structures and functions. We have been investigating the transition to chlorosis and the return to vegetative growth as a simple model of a cellular developmental process and a fundamental survival strategy in biology. In the present study, we used quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics to describe the proteomic landscape of a dormant cyanobacterium and its dynamics during the transition to vegetative growth. We identified intriguing alterations in the set of ribosomal proteins, in RuBisCO components, in the abundance of central regulators and predicted metabolic enzymes. We found O-phosphorylation as an abundant protein modification in the chlorotic state, specifically of metabolic enzymes and proteins involved in photosynthesis.

      "Stress effects of cyanotoxin β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) on cyanobacterial heterocyst formation and functionality.\n",
      "Various species of cyanobacteria, diatoms and dinoflagellates are capable of synthesizing the non-proteinogenic neurotoxic amino acid β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), which is known to be a causative agent of human neurodegeneration. Similar to most cyanotoxins, the biological and ecological functions of BMAA in cyanobacteria are unknown. In this study, we show for the first time that BMAA, in micromolar amounts, inhibits the formation of heterocysts (specialized nitrogen-fixing cells) in heterocystous, diazotrophic cyanobacteria [Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 (ATCC 29133), Nostoc sp. strain 8963] under conditions of nitrogen starvation. The inhibitory effect of BMAA is abolished by the addition of glutamate. To understand the genetic reason for the observed phenomenon, we used qPCR to study the expression of key genes involved in cell differentiation and nitrogen metabolism in the model cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. We observed that in the presence of BMAA, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 does not express two essential genes associated with heterocyst differentiation, namely, hetR and hepA. We also found that addition of BMAA to cyanobacterial cultures with mature heterocysts inhibits nifH gene expression and nitrogenase activity.\n",

      "Microcystin-LR does not induce alterations to transcriptomic or metabolomic profiles of a model heterotrophic bacterium.\n",
      "Microcystins are secondary metabolites produced by several freshwater, bloom-forming cyanobacterial species. Microcystin-producing cyanobacteria co-occur with a complex community of heterotrophic bacteria. Though conflicting, studies suggest that microcystins affect the physiology of heterotrophic bacteria by inducing oxidative stress and increasing cell envelope permeability. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that exposure to microcystin should induce differential expression in genes responding to oxidative and envelope stress and trigger shifts in metabolite pools. We tested this hypothesis by exposing Escherichia coli MG1655 to 1 and 10 mg/L microcystin-LR and monitored global changes to gene expression, cellular metabolite pools, and lipid composition using RNA-sequencing and UPLC-MS. Contrary to reported studies, we observed no evidence that microcystin-LR induced oxidative or cell envelope stress in E. coli under the tested conditions. Our results suggest a potential difference in mechanism by which microcystin-LR interacts with heterotrophic bacteria vs. cyanobacteria.\n",

      "Increasing effects of anthropogenic stressors and those of natural origin on aquatic ecosystems have intensified the need for predictive and functional models of their effects. Here, we use gene expression patterns in combination with weighted gene coexpression networks and generalized additive models to predict effects on reproduction in the aquatic microcrustacean Daphnia. We developed models to predict effects on reproduction upon exposure to different cyanobacteria, different insecticides and binary mixtures of cyanobacteria and insecticides. Models developed specifically for groups of stressors (e.g., either cyanobacteria or insecticides) performed better than general models developed on all data. Furthermore, models developed using in silico generated mixture gene expression profiles from single stressor data were able to better predict effects on reproduction compared to models derived from the mixture exposures themselves. Our results highlight the potential of gene expression data to quantify effects of complex exposures at higher level organismal effects without prior mechanistic knowledge or complex exposure data.\n",

      "Translating Divergent Environmental Stresses into a Common Proteome Response through the Histidine Kinase 33 (Hik33) in a Model Cyanobacterium.\n",
      "The histidine kinase Hik33 plays important roles in mediating cyanobacterial response to divergent types of abiotic stresses including cold, salt, high light (HL), and osmotic stresses. However, how these functions are regulated by Hik33 remains to be addressed. Using a hik33-deficient strain (Δhik33) of  sp. PCC 6803 () and quantitative proteomics, we found that Hik33 depletion induces differential protein expression highly like that induced by divergent types of stresses. This typically includes downregulation of proteins in photosynthesis and carbon assimilation that are necessary for cell propagation, and upregulation of heat shock proteins, chaperons, and proteases that are important for cell survival. This observation indicates that depletion of Hik33 alone mimics divergent types of abiotic stresses, and that Hik33 could be important for preventing abnormal stress response in the normal condition. Moreover, we found most proteins of plasmid origin were significantly upregulated in Δhik33, though their biological significance remains to be addressed. Together, the systematically characterized Hik33-regulated cyanobacterial proteome, which is largely involved in stress responses, builds the molecular basis for Hik33 as a general regulator of stress responses.\n",

      "Little is known about the influence that environmental stressors may have on genome-wide methylation patterns, and to what extent epigenetics may be involved in environmental stress response. Yet, studies of methylation patterns under stress could provide crucial insights on stress response and toxicity pathways. Here, we focus on genome-wide methylation patterns in the microcrustacean Daphnia magna, a model organism in ecotoxicology and risk assessment, exposed to the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. Bisulfite sequencing of exposed and control animals highlighted differential methylation patterns in Daphnia upon exposure to Microcystis primarily in exonic regions. These patterns are enriched for serine/threonine amino acid codons and genes related to protein synthesis, transport and degradation. Furthermore, we observed that genes with differential methylation corresponded well with genes susceptible to alternative splicing in response to Microcystis stress. Overall, our results suggest a complex mechanistic response in Daphnia characterized by interactions between DNA methylation and gene regulation mechanisms. These results underscore that DNA methylation is modulated by environmental stress and can also be an integral part of the toxicity response in our study species.\n",

      "Variety of DNA Replication Activity Among Cyanobacteria Correlates with Distinct Respiration Activity in the Dark.\n",
      "Cyanobacteria exhibit light-dependent cell growth since most of their cellular energy is obtained by photosynthesis. In Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, one of the model cyanobacteria, DNA replication depends on photosynthetic electron transport. However, the critical signal for the regulatory mechanism of DNA replication has not been identified. In addition, conservation of this regulatory mechanism has not been investigated among cyanobacteria. To understand this regulatory signal and its dependence on light, we examined the regulation of DNA replication under both light and dark conditions among three model cyanobacteria, S. elongatus PCC 7942, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. Interestingly, DNA replication activity in Synechocystis and Anabaena was retained when cells were transferred to the dark, although it was drastically decreased in S. elongatus. Glycogen metabolism and respiration were higher in Synechocystis and Anabaena than in S. elongatus in the dark. Moreover, DNA replication activity in Synechocystis and Anabaena was reduced to the same level as that in S. elongatus by inhibition of respiratory electron transport after transfer to the dark. These results demonstrate that there is disparity in DNA replication occurring in the dark among cyanobacteria, which is caused by the difference in activity of respiratory electron transport.\n",

      "Peptide and protein identification remains challenging in organisms with poorly annotated or rapidly evolving genomes, as are commonly encountered in environmental or biofuels research. Such limitations render tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) database search algorithms ineffective as they lack corresponding sequences required for peptide-spectrum matching. We address this challenge with the spectral networks approach to (1) match spectra of orthologous peptides across multiple related species and then (2) propagate peptide annotations from identified to unidentified spectra. We here present algorithms to assess the statistical significance of spectral alignments (Align-GF), reduce the impurity in spectral networks, and accurately estimate the error rate in propagated identifications. Analyzing three related Cyanothece species, a model organism for biohydrogen production, spectral networks identified peptides from highly divergent sequences from networks with dozens of variant peptides, including thousands of peptides in species lacking a sequenced genome. Our analysis further detected the presence of many novel putative peptides even in genomically characterized species, thus suggesting the possibility of gaps in our understanding of their proteomic and genomic expression.

      "Cyanobacterial blooms often occur in freshwater lakes and constitute a potential health risk to human populations, as well as to other organisms. However, their overall and specific implications for the health of aquatic organisms that are chronically and environmentally exposed to cyanobacteria producing hepatotoxins, such as microcystins (MCs), together with other bioactive compounds have still not been clearly established and remain difficult to assess. The medaka fish was chosen as the experimental aquatic model for studying the cellular and molecular toxicological effects on the liver after chronic exposures (28 days) to environmentally relevant concentrations of pure MC-LR, complex extracts of MC producing or nonproducing cyanobacterial biomasses, and of a Microcystis aeruginosa natural bloom. Our results showed a higher susceptibility of females to the different treatments compared to males at both the cellular and the molecular levels. Although hepatocyte lysis increased with MC-containing treatments, lysis always appeared more severe in the liver of females compare to males, and the glycogen cellular reserves also appeared to decrease more in the liver of females compared to those in the males. Proteomic investigations reveal divergent responses between males and females exposed to all treatments, especially for proteins involved in metabolic and homeostasis processes. Our observations also highlighted the dysregulation of proteins involved in oogenesis in female livers. These results suggest that fish populations exposed to cyanobacteria blooms may potentially face several ecotoxicological issues.\n",

      "The non-protein amino acid β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a neurotoxin present in microalgae and shown to accumulate in the food web. BMAA has been linked to the complex neurodegenerative disorder of Guam and to increased incidents sporadic ALS. Two main neurotoxic routes are suggested; an excitotoxic by acting as an agonist towards glutamate receptors and a metabolic by misincorporating into cellular proteins. We have used zebrafish, an increasingly used model for neurodegenerative diseases, to further identify signaling components involved in BMAA-induced toxicity. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to sub-lethal dosages of BMAA and a label-free proteomics analysis was conducted on larvae 4 days post fertilization. The exposed larvae showed no developmental abnormalities, but a reduced heart rate and increased expression of GSK3 isoforms. Search towards a reviewed database containing 2968 entries identified 480 proteins. Only 17 of these were regulated 2-fold or more in the exposed larvae. Seven of these proteins could be associated to glutamate receptor signaling and recycling. The remaining nine have all been linked to disturbance in protein homeostasis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) development or neuronal cell death. We also found that BMAA influenced the endocannabinoid system by up-regulation of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and that FAAH inhibitor URB597 reduced the BMAA effect on heart rate and GSK3 expression.\n",

      "Ethylene is a plant hormone that plays a crucial role in the growth and development of plants. The ethylene receptors in plants are well studied, and it is generally assumed that they are found only in plants. In a search of sequenced genomes, we found that many bacterial species contain putative ethylene receptors. Plants acquired many proteins from cyanobacteria as a result of the endosymbiotic event that led to chloroplasts. We provide data that the cyanobacterium Synechocystis (Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803) has a functional receptor for ethylene, Synechocystis Ethylene Response1 (SynEtr1). We first show that SynEtr1 directly binds ethylene. Second, we demonstrate that application of ethylene to Synechocystis cells or disruption of the SynEtr1 gene affects several processes, including phototaxis, type IV pilus biosynthesis, photosystem II levels, biofilm formation, and spontaneous cell sedimentation. Our data suggest a model where SynEtr1 inhibits downstream signaling and ethylene inhibits SynEtr1. This is similar to the inverse-agonist model of ethylene receptor signaling proposed for plants and suggests a conservation of structure and function that possibly originated over 1 billion years ago. Prior research showed that SynEtr1 also contains a light-responsive phytochrome-like domain. Thus, SynEtr1 is a bifunctional receptor that mediates responses to both light and ethylene. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a functional ethylene receptor in a nonplant species and suggests that that the perception of ethylene is more widespread than previously thought.\n",

      "Some of the most common toxins present in freshwater, in particular microcystins (MCs), are produced by cyanobacteria. These toxins have a negative impact on human health, being associated with episodes of acute hepatotoxicity and being considered potentially carcinogenic to humans. To date the exact mechanisms of MC-induced toxicity and tumor promotion were not completely elucidated. To get new insights underlying microcystin-LR (MCLR) molecular mechanisms of toxicity we have performed the proteomic profiling using two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells exposed for 4 h-1 nM and 1 μM of MCLR, and compared them to the control (cells not exposed to MCLR). We identified 14 differentially expressed proteins. The identified proteins are involved in metabolism, genotoxicity, cytotoxicity and stress response. Furthermore, we evaluated the relative expression of yeast's PP1 and PP2A genes and also of genes from the Base Excision Repair (BER) DNA-repair system, and observed that three out of the five genes analyzed displayed dose-dependent responses. Overall, the different proteins and genes affected are related to oxidative stress and apoptosis, thus reinforcing that it is probably the main mechanism of MCLR toxicity transversal to several organisms, especially at lower doses. Notwithstanding these MCLR responsive proteins could be object of further studies to evaluate their suitability as biomarkers of exposure to the toxin.\n",

      "Using genetics and metabolomics we investigated the synthesis (gshA and gshB genes) and catabolism (ggt) of the conserved antioxidant glutathione in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803. These three genes are crucial to Synechocystis, in agreement with the proposed invention of glutathione by ancient cyanobacteria to protect themselves against the toxicity of oxygen they produced through photosynthesis. Consistent with their indispensability, gshA and gshB also operate in the production of another antioxidant, ergothioneine, as well as of the glutathione analogues ophthalmate and norophthalmate. Furthermore, we show that glutathione, ophthalmate and norophthalmate are accumulated in cells stressed by glucose, and that the two glutathione-dependent glyoxalase enzymes operate in the protection against glucose and its catabolite methylglyoxal. These findings are interesting because ophthalmate and norophthalmate were observed only in mammals so far, where ophthalmate is regarded as a biomarker of glutathione depletion. Instead, our data suggest that ophthalmate and norophthalmate are stress-induced markers of cysteine depletion triggered by its accelerated incorporation into glutathione, to face its increased demand for detoxification purposes. Hence, Synechocystis is an attractive model for the analysis of the role of glutathione, ergothioneine, ophthalmate and norophthalmate, in signalling and detoxification of oxidants and metabolic by-products.\n",

      "The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (S. 6803) is a well-established model species in oxygenic photosynthesis research and a potential host for biotechnological applications. Despite recent advances in genome sequencing and microarray techniques applied in systems biology, quantitative proteomics approaches with corresponding accuracy and depth are scarce for S. 6803. In this study, we developed a protocol to screen changes in the expression of 106 proteins representing central metabolic pathways in S. 6803 with a targeted mass spectrometry method, selected reaction monitoring (SRM). We evaluated the response to the exposure of both short- and long-term iron deprivation. The experimental setup enabled the relative quantification of 96 proteins, with 87 and 92 proteins showing adjusted p-values <0.01 under short- and long-term iron deficiency, respectively. The high sensitivity of the SRM method for S. 6803 was demonstrated by providing quantitative data for altogether 64 proteins that previously could not be detected with the classical data-dependent MS approach under similar conditions. This highlights the effectiveness of SRM for quantification and extends the analytical capability to low-abundance proteins in unfractionated samples of S. 6803. The SRM assays and other generated information are now publicly available via PASSEL and Panorama.\n",

      "In Australia, saxitoxin production is strain dependent within the bloom-forming freshwater cyanobacterium Anabaena circinalis. Freshwater cyanobacteria are exposed to rapid fluctuations in environmental nutrient concentrations, and their adaption is vital for competition, succession and dominance. Two elements of environmental significance, phosphorus and sodium chloride, are proposed to play a role in bloom development and saxitoxin biosynthesis respectively. The aim of our study was to comparatively analyse the model saxitoxin-producing A. circinalis AWQC131C and non-toxic A. circinalis AWQC310F at the genomic level and proteomic level, in response to phosphate depletion and increased extracellular NaCl. When challenged, photosynthesis, carbon/nitrogen metabolisms, transcription/translation, oxidative stress and nutrient transport functional categories demonstrated the largest changes in protein abundance. In response to increased NaCl, SxtC, a protein conserved in all known saxitoxin biosynthetic pathways, was downregulated. Additionally, toxin quantification revealed a decrease in total saxitoxin and decarbomoyl-gonyautoxin2/3 content in response to the NaCl treatment. In response to phosphate depletion, the toxic and non-toxic strain displayed similar proteomic profiles, although the toxic strain did not alter the abundance of as many proteins as the non-toxic strain. These findings have important implications for the future, since response and adaption mechanisms are directly related to in situ dominance of cyanobacteria.\n",

To address this, we used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to compare the global transcriptome of two exponential-phase populations of Prochlorococcus AS9601 cells - acclimated to high salt (5%, w/v) and normal seawater salt (3.8%, w/v). Experiments showed that salt acclimated cells exhibit slower growth rates with a doubling time almost twice as controls. Approximately 1/3 of the genome was found to be differentially expressed (p-value <0.05), but a considerably large number of these genes are \"hypothetical proteins\" with unknown function. Transcript abundance were higher for genes involved in respiratory electron flow, carbon fixation, osmolyte/compatible solute biosynthesis and inorganic ion transport. Many of the highly expressed genes are 'high light inducible proteins' believed to be part of the general Prochlorococcus stress response. Transcript abundance were lower for genes involved in photosynthetic electron transport and cell division. The relative reduction in transcript abundance for genes encoding proteins containing heme groups and iron transporters suggests cellular iron requirements in salt acclimated cells maybe lower. The results presented here provide the first glimpse into global gene expression changes in Prochlorococcus cells due to salt stress.\n",

      "Despite a significant increase in genomic data, our knowledge of gene functions and their transcriptional responses to environmental stimuli remains limited. Here, we use the model keystone species Daphnia pulex to study environmental responses of genes in the context of their gene family history to better understand the relationship between genome structure and gene function in response to environmental stimuli. Daphnia were exposed to five different treatments, each consisting of a diet supplemented with one of five cyanobacterial species, and a control treatment consisting of a diet of only green algae. Differential gene expression profiles of Daphnia exposed to each of these five cyanobacterial species showed that genes with known functions are more likely to be shared by different expression profiles, whereas genes specific to the lineage of Daphnia are more likely to be unique to a given expression profile. Furthermore, while only a small number of nonlineage-specific genes were conserved across treatment type, there was a high degree of overlap in expression profiles at the functional level. The conservation of functional responses across the different cyanobacterial treatments can be attributed to the treatment-specific expression of different paralogous genes within the same gene family. Comparison with available gene expression data in the literature suggests differences in nutritional composition in diets with cyanobacterial species compared to diets of green algae as a primary driver for cyanobacterial effects on Daphnia. We conclude that conserved functional responses in Daphnia across different cyanobacterial treatments are mediated through alternate regulation of paralogous gene families.\n",

      "In summary, we could show the involvement of a Hik8-cascade in the expression of genes involved in the glycolytic and OPP pathways induced by GPL, and another signal pathway under photosynthetic conditions in Synechocystis . The Hik8-cascade under GPL conditions may regulate glucose degradation to produce some energy and carbon compounds. This cascade might be important for the supply of organic materials such as amino acids and nucleotides through enhancement of the rates of the glycolysis and OPP pathways. Histidine kinase Hik8 upregulates the expression of one of the important glycolytic genes, fbaA, via sll1330 under heterotrophic growth conditions (i.e., in the presence of glucose with an indispensable short period of light) in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In this study, expression of the genes for the glycolytic and OPP pathways was investigated using the wild type, and disruption mutants of Hik8 and sll1330, to determine whether or not the Hik8-involving signal transduction system generally regulates glucose catabolism. In the wild type, all the genes for the glycolytic and OPP pathways were upregulated under the same conditions as for fbaA. Analyses of the disruption mutants suggested that the signal transduction system involving Hik8 and Sll1330 plays a key role in the upregulation of genes such as pfkA, pgmB, and glk, and also that Hik8 induces genes including gap1 and pgk independently of Sll1330. This complicated signal transduction cascade, designated as the Hik8-cascade, occurs under heterotrophic growth with light pulses. In addition, a disruption mutant of a putative histidine kinase, sll1334, exhibited growth and gene expression patterns that suggested it to be a negative regulator in the cascade. Possible histidine kinases and response regulators as candidates for other components in the cascade are discussed.\n",

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in HL response by Synechococcus 7002 are not well understood. Here, an integrated RNA sequencing transcriptomic and quantitative proteomic analysis was performed to investigate the cellular response to HL in Synechococcus 7002. A total of 526 transcripts and 233 proteins were identified to be differentially regulated under HL stress. Data analysis revealed major changes in mRNAs and proteins involved in the photosynthesis pathways, resistance to light-induced damage, DNA replication and repair, and energy metabolism. A set of differentially expressed mRNAs and proteins were validated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Twelve genes differentially regulated under HL stress were selected for knockout generation and growth analysis of these mutants led to the identification of key genes involved in the response of HL in Synechococcus 7002.

The present study aimed to improve the authors' understanding of the role of cytosine methylation in the organism's response to environmental conditions. The authors observed a significant genotype effect, an environment effect, and a genotype × environment effect. In particular, global cytosine methylation levels were significantly altered after exposure to Triops predation cues, Microcystis, and sodium chloride compared with control conditions. Significant differences between the 2 genotypes were observed when animals were exposed to Triops predation cues, Microcystis, Cryptomonas, and sodium chloride. Despite the low global methylation rate under control conditions (0.49-0.52%), global cytosine methylation levels upon exposure to Triops demonstrated a 5-fold difference between the genotypes (0.21% vs 1.02%). No effects were found in response to arsenic, cadmium, fish, lead, pH of 5.5, pH of 8, temperature, hypoxia, and white fat cell disease. The authors' results point to the potential role of epigenetic effects under changing environmental conditions such as predation (i.e., Triops), diet (i.e., Cryptomonas and Microcystis), and salinity.

      "Glutathionylation, the reversible post-translational formation of a mixed disulfide between a cysteine residue and glutathione (GSH), is a crucial mechanism for signal transduction and regulation of protein function. Until now this reversible redox modification was studied mainly in eukaryotic cells. Here we report a large-scale proteomic analysis of glutathionylation in a photosynthetic prokaryote, the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Treatment of acellular extracts with N,N-biotinyl glutathione disulfide (BioGSSG) induced glutathionylation of numerous proteins, which were subsequently isolated by affinity chromatography on streptavidin columns and identified by nano LC-MS/MS analysis. Potential sites of glutathionylation were also determined for 125 proteins following tryptic cleavage, streptavidin-affinity purification, and mass spectrometry analysis. Taken together the two approaches allowed the identification of 383 glutathionylatable proteins that participate in a wide range of cellular processes and metabolic pathways such as carbon and nitrogen metabolisms, cell division, stress responses, and H2 production. In addition, the glutathionylation of two putative targets, namely, peroxiredoxin (Sll1621) involved in oxidative stress tolerance and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Sll1908) acting on amino acids metabolism, was confirmed by biochemical studies on the purified recombinant proteins.

Therefore, we investigated the inhibitory effects of S. platensis on UVB-induced skin tumor development in Ogg1 knockout-(KO) mice and the wild-type (WT) counterpart. Dietary S. platensis suppressed tumor induction and development in both genotypes compared with our previous data without S. platensis. Induction of erythema and ear swelling, one of the hallmarks of UVB-induced inflammatory responses, was suppressed in the skin of Ogg1-KO mice and albino hairless mice fed with dietary S. platensis. Compared with untreated mice, S. platensis-administered mice showed significantly reduced 8-oxoG formation in the skin after UVB exposure. Moreover, we found that S. platensis effectively downregulated the signal proteins p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase after UVB exposure especially in Ogg1-KO mice. Our results suggest that S. platensis exerts antitumor effects against UVB irradiation in the skin through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.\n",

      "Metabolomic analysis of the salt-sensitive mutants reveals changes in amino acid and fatty acid composition important to long-term salt stress in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.\n",
      "Early studies in cyanobacteria have found that few genes induced by short-term salt shock (15-60 min) display a stable induction in the long-term (>1 day) salt-acclimated cells; meanwhile, most of the genes responsive to long-term salt stress were different from those by short-term salt shock, suggesting that different regulatory mechanisms may be involved for short-term and long-term salt stress responses. In our previous work using the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, sll1734 encoding CO2 uptake-related protein (CupA) and three genes encoding hypothetical proteins (i.e., ssr3402, slr1339, and ssr1853) were found induced significantly after a 3-day salt stress, and the corresponding gene knockout mutants were found salt sensitive. To further decipher the mechanisms that these genes may be involved, in this study, we performed a comparative metabolomic analysis of the wild-type Synechocystis and the four salt-sensitive mutants using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) approach. A metabolomic data set that consisted of 60 chemically classified metabolites was then subjected to a weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the metabolic modules and hub metabolites specifically related to each of the salt-stressed mutants. The results showed that two, one, zero, and two metabolic modules were identified specifically associated with the knockout events of sll1734, ssr3402, slr1339, and ssr1853, respectively. The mutant-associated modules included metabolites such as lysine and palmitic acid, suggesting that amino acid and fatty acid metabolisms are among the key protection mechanisms against long-term salt stresses in Synechocystis. The metabolomic results were further confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analysis, which showed the upregulation of lysine and fatty acid synthesis-related genes. The study provided new insights on metabolic networks involved in long-term salt stress response in Synechocystis.\n",

      "The present study investigated the possibilities and limitations of implementing a genome-wide transcription-based approach that takes into account genetic and environmental variation to better understand the response of natural populations to stressors. When exposing two different Daphnia pulex genotypes (a cadmium-sensitive and a cadmium-tolerant one) to cadmium, the toxic cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa, and their mixture, we found that observations at the transcriptomic level do not always explain observations at a higher level (growth, reproduction). For example, although cadmium elicited an adverse effect at the organismal level, almost no genes were differentially expressed after cadmium exposure. In addition, we identified oxidative stress and polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism-related pathways, as well as trypsin and neurexin IV gene-families as candidates for the underlying causes of genotypic differences in tolerance to Microcystis. Furthermore, the whole-genome transcriptomic data of a stressor mixture allowed a better understanding of mixture responses by evaluating interactions between two stressors at the gene-expression level against the independent action baseline model. This approach has indicated that ubiquinone pathway and the MAPK serine-threonine protein kinase and collagens gene-families were enriched with genes showing an interactive effect in expression response to exposure to the mixture of the stressors, while transcription and translation-related pathways and gene-families were mostly related with genotypic differences in interactive responses to this mixture. Collectively, our results indicate that the methods we employed may improve further characterization of the possibilities and limitations of transcriptomics approaches in the adverse outcome pathway framework and in predictions of multistressor effects on natural populations.\n",

      "Salt stress is a common stress that limits growth and productivity of photosynthetic microbes in natural environments. Although cellular responses of a model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 to high and changing salt concentration have been studied, it remains undefined of the gene components and their regulation in the long-term salt acclimation networks. In this study, we performed an integrated study coupling a quantitative iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS proteomics and a next-generation sequencing-based RNA-seq transcriptomics on Synechocystis under salt stress for an extended period of time. Comparative quantification of protein abundances led to the identification of 68 and 108 proteins differentially regulated by salt treatment at 24 and 48 h, respectively. RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis showed that genes involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis, and genes encoding hypothetical proteins responded to salt stress in a phase-dependent pattern. Notably, a gene encoding CO2-uptake-related protein (CupA) and three genes encoding hypothetical proteins were induced significantly at either transcript or protein level after long-term salt stress. Gene knockout and comparative growth analysis demonstrated that these four genes were involved in salt tolerance in Synechocystis. In addition, a complementary proteome and transcriptome analysis showed that concordance between protein abundances and their corresponding mRNAs varied significantly between various gene-protein pairs, indicating divergent regulation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes during salt stress adaptation in Synechocystis. The study provided new insights on genes and regulatory mechanism involved in salt stress response in Synechocystis.\n",

      "In silico analysis of putative paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins export proteins in cyanobacteria.\n",
      "Paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PSTs) are a family of more than 30 natural alkaloids synthesized by dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria whose toxicity in animals is mediated by voltage-gated Na(+) channel blocking. The export of PST analogues may be through SxtF and SxtM, two putative MATE (multidrug and toxic compound extrusion) family transporters encoded in PSTs biosynthetic gene cluster (sxt). sxtM is present in every sxt cluster analyzed; however, sxtF is only present in the Cylindrospermopsis-Raphidiopsis clade. These transporters are energetically coupled with an electrochemical gradient of proton (H(+)) or sodium (Na(+)) ions across membranes. Because the functional role of PSTs remains unknown and methods for genetic manipulation in PST-producing organisms have not yet been developed, protein structure analyses will allow us to understand their function. By analyzing the sxt cluster of eight PST-producing cyanobacteria, we found no correlation between the presence of sxtF or sxtM and a specific PSTs profile. Phylogenetic analyses of SxtF/M showed a high conservation of SxtF in the Cylindrospermopsis-Raphidiopsis clade, suggesting conserved substrate affinity. Two domains involved in Na(+) and drug recognition from NorM proteins (MATE family) of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae are present in SxtF/M. The Na(+) recognition domain was conserved in both SxtF/M, indicating that Na(+) can maintain the role as a cation anti-transporter. Consensus motifs for toxin binding differed between SxtF and SxtM implying differential substrate binding. Through protein modeling and docking analysis, we found that there is no marked affinity between the recognition domain and a specific PST analogue. This agrees with our previous results of PST export in R. brookii D9, where we observed that the response to Na(+) incubation was similar to different analogues. These results reassert the hypothesis regarding the involvement of Na(+) in toxin export, as well as the motifs L(398)XGLQD(403) (SxtM) and L(390)VGLRD(395) (SxtF) in toxin recognition.\n",

      "Cyanobacteria in nature are exposed not only to the visible spectrum of sunlight but also to its harmful ultraviolet components (UVA and UVB). We used Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 as a model to study the UVA response by analyzing global gene expression patterns using genomic microarrays. UVA exposure resulted in the statistically detectable differential expression of 573 genes of the 6903 that were probed, compared with that of the control cultures. Of those genes, 473 were up-regulated, while only 100 were down-regulated. Many of the down-regulated genes were involved in photosynthetic pigment biosynthesis, indicating a significant shift in this metabolism. As expected, we detected the up-regulation of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes and the sunscreen, scytonemin. However, a majority of the up-regulated genes, 47%, were unassignable bioinformatically to known functional categories, suggesting that the UVA stress response is not well understood. Interestingly, the most dramatic up-regulation involved several contiguous genes of unassigned metabolism on plasmid A. This is the first global UVA stress response analysis of any phototrophic microorganism and the differential expression of 8% of the genes of the Nostoc genome indicates that adaptation to UVA in Nostoc has been an evolutionary force of significance.\n",

      "A conserved hypothetical protein, Sll1130, is a novel transcription factor that regulates the expression of major heat-responsive genes in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Synechocystis exhibited an increased thermotolerance due to disruption of sll1130. Δsll1130 cells recovered much faster than wild-type cells after they were subjected to heat shock (50°C) for 30 min followed by recovery at 34°C for 48 h. In Δsll1130 cultures, 70% of the cells were viable compared with the wild-type culture in which only 30% of the cells were viable. DNA microarray analysis revealed that in Δsll1130, expression of the heat-responsive genes such as htpG, hspA, isiA, isiB and several hypothetical genes were up-regulated. Sll1130 binds to a conserved inverted-repeat (GGCGATCGCC) located in the upstream region of the above genes. In addition, both the transcript and protein levels of sll1130 were immediately down-regulated upon shift of wild-type cells from 34 to 42°C. Collectively the results of the present study suggest that Sll1130 is a heat-responsive transcriptional regulator that represses the expression of certain heat-inducible genes at optimum growth temperatures. Upon heat shock, a quick drop in the Sll1130 levels leads to de-repression of the heat-shock genes and subsequent thermal acclimation. On the basis of the findings of the present study, we present a model which describes the heat-shock response involving Sll1130.\n",

      "Metabolic pathway confirmation and discovery through (13)C-labeling of proteinogenic amino acids.\n",
      "Microbes have complex metabolic pathways that can be investigated using biochemistry and functional genomics methods. One important technique to examine cell central metabolism and discover new enzymes is (13)C-assisted metabolism analysis 1. This technique is based on isotopic labeling, whereby microbes are fed with a (13)C labeled substrates. By tracing the atom transition paths between metabolites in the biochemical network, we can determine functional pathways and discover new enzymes. As a complementary method to transcriptomics and proteomics, approaches for isotopomer-assisted analysis of metabolic pathways contain three major steps (2). First, we grow cells with (13)C labeled substrates. In this step, the composition of the medium and the selection of labeled substrates are two key factors. To avoid measurement noises from non-labeled carbon in nutrient supplements, a minimal medium with a sole carbon source is required. Further, the choice of a labeled substrate is based on how effectively it will elucidate the pathway being analyzed. Because novel enzymes often involve different reaction stereochemistry or intermediate products, in general, singly labeled carbon substrates are more informative for detection of novel pathways than uniformly labeled ones for detection of novel pathways(3, 4). Second, we analyze amino acid labeling patterns using GC-MS. Amino acids are abundant in protein and thus can be obtained from biomass hydrolysis. Amino acids can be derivatized by N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (TBDMS) before GC separation. TBDMS derivatized amino acids can be fragmented by MS and result in different arrays of fragments. Based on the mass to charge (m/z) ratio of fragmented and unfragmented amino acids, we can deduce the possible labeled patterns of the central metabolites that are precursors of the amino acids. Third, we trace 13C carbon transitions in the proposed pathways and, based on the isotopomer data, confirm whether these pathways are active (2). Measurement of amino acids provides isotopic labeling information about eight crucial precursor metabolites in the central metabolism. These metabolic key nodes can reflect the functions of associated central pathways. (13)C-assisted metabolism analysis via proteinogenic amino acids can be widely used for functional characterization of poorly-characterized microbial metabolism(1). In this protocol, we will use Cyanothece 51142 as the model strain to demonstrate the use of labeled carbon substrates for discovering new enzymatic functions.\n",

      "Unicellular cyanobacteria of the genus Cyanothece are recognized for their ability to execute nitrogen (N2)-fixation in the dark and photosynthesis in the light. An understanding of these mechanistic processes in an integrated systems context should provide insights into how Cyanothece might be optimized for specialized environments and/or industrial purposes. Systems-wide dynamic proteomic profiling with mass spectrometry (MS) analysis should reveal fundamental insights into the control and regulation of these functions.\n",
      "To expand upon the current knowledge of protein expression patterns in Cyanothece ATCC51142, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis using partial (\"unsaturated\") metabolic labeling and high mass accuracy LC-MS analysis. This dynamic proteomic profiling identified 721 actively synthesized proteins with significant temporal changes in expression throughout the light-dark cycles, of which 425 proteins matched with previously characterized cycling transcripts. The remaining 296 proteins contained a cluster of proteins uniquely involved in DNA replication and repair, protein degradation, tRNA synthesis and modification, transport and binding, and regulatory functions. Functional classification of labeled proteins suggested that proteins involved in respiration and glycogen metabolism showed increased expression in the dark cycle together with nitrogenase, suggesting that N2-fixation is mediated by higher respiration and glycogen metabolism. Results indicated that Cyanothece ATCC51142 might utilize alternative pathways for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) acquisition, particularly, aspartic acid and glutamate as substrates of C and N, respectively. Utilization of phosphoketolase (PHK) pathway for the conversion of xylulose-5P to pyruvate and acetyl-P likely constitutes an alternative strategy to compensate higher ATP and NADPH demand.\n",

      "There are two closely related hik31 operons involved in signal transduction on the chromosome and the pSYSX plasmid in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. We studied the growth, cell morphology, and gene expression in operon and hik mutants for both copies, under different growth conditions, to examine whether the duplicated copies have the same or different functions and gene targets and whether they are similarly regulated. Phenotype analysis suggested that both operons regulated common and separate targets in the light and the dark. The chromosomal operon was involved in the negative control of autotrophic events, whereas the plasmid operon was involved in the positive control of heterotrophic events. Both the plasmid and double operon mutant cells were larger and had division defects. The growth data also showed a regulatory role for the chromosomal hik gene under high-CO(2) conditions and the plasmid operon under low-O(2) conditions. Metal stress experiments indicated a role for the chromosomal hik gene and operon in mediating Zn and Cd tolerance, the plasmid operon in Co tolerance, and the chromosomal operon and plasmid hik gene in Ni tolerance. We conclude that both operons are differentially and temporally regulated. We suggest that the chromosomal operon is the primarily expressed copy and the plasmid operon acts as a backup to maintain appropriate gene dosages. Both operons share an integrated regulatory relationship and are induced in high light, in glucose, and in active cell growth. Additionally, the plasmid operon is induced in the dark with or without glucose.\n",

      "Proteomics in conjunction with morphological, physiological and biochemical variables has been employed for the first time to unravel survival strategies of the diazotrophic cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC7120 under Arsenic (As) stress. Significant reduction in growth, carbon fixation, nitrogenase activity and chlorophyll content after 1 day (1d) and recovery after 15 days (15d) of As exposure indicates the acclimation of the test organism against As stress. The formation of akinete like structures is a novel observation never reported before in Anabaena sp. PCC7120. Proteomic characterization using 2-DE showed average 537, 422 and 439 spots in control, 1 and 15d treatment respectively. MALDI-TOF and LC-MS of As-treated Anabaena revealed a total of 45 differentially expressed proteins, of which 13 were novel (hypothetical) ones. Down-regulation of phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), fructose bisphosphate aldolase II (FBA II), fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase (FBPase), transketolase (TK), and ATP synthase on day 1 and their significant recovery on the 15th day presumably maintained the glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and turnover rate of Calvin cycle, hence survival of the test organism. Up-regulation of catalase (CAT), peroxiredoxin (Prx), thioredoxin (Trx) and oxidoreductase appears to protect the cells from oxidative stress. Appreciable induction in phytochelatin content (2.4 fold), GST activity (2.3 fold), and transcripts of phytochelatin synthase (5.0 fold), arsenate reductase (8.5 fold) and arsenite efflux genes - asr1102 (5.0 fold), alr1097 (4.7 fold) reiterates their role in As sequestration and shielding of the organism from As toxicity. While up-regulated metabolic and antioxidative defense proteins, phytochelatin and GST work synchronously, the ars genes play a central role in detoxification and survival of Anabaena under As stress. The proposed hypothetical model explains the interaction of metabolic proteins associated with the survival of Anabaena sp. PCC7120 under As stress.\n",

The approach combines the general utility of using consensus model spectra typical of database search methods with the accuracy of the intensity information contained in spectral libraries. A common scoring metric based on recent developments linking data analysis and statistical thermodynamics is used, which allows the use of a conservative estimate of error rates for the combined data. We applied this approach to proteomics analysis of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, a cyanobacterium that is a model organism for studies of photosynthetic carbon fixation and biofuels development.

      "Compatible solute biosynthesis in cyanobacteria.\n",
      "Compatible solutes are a functional group of small, highly soluble organic molecules that demonstrate compatibility in high amounts with cellular metabolism. The accumulation of compatible solutes is often observed during the acclimation of organisms to adverse environmental conditions, particularly to salt and drought stress. Among cyanobacteria, sucrose, trehalose, glucosylglycerol and glycine betaine are used as major compatible solutes. Interestingly, a close correlation has been discovered between the final salt tolerance limit and the primary compatible solute in these organisms. In addition to the dominant compatible solutes, many strains accumulate mixtures of these compounds, including minor compounds such as glucosylglycerate or proline as secondary or tertiary solutes. In particular, the accumulation of sucrose and trehalose results in an increase in tolerance to general stresses such as desiccation and high temperatures. During recent years, the biochemical and molecular basis of compatible solute accumulation has been characterized using cyanobacterial model strains that comprise different salt tolerance groups. Based on these data, the distribution of genes involved in compatible solute synthesis among sequenced cyanobacterial genomes is reviewed, and thereby, the major compatible solutes and potential salt tolerance of these strains can be predicted. Knowledge regarding cyanobacterial salt tolerance is not only useful to characterize strain-specific adaptations to ecological niches, but it can also be used to generate cells with increased tolerance to adverse environmental conditions for biotechnological purposes.\n",

      "Cyanobacteria, the only prokaryotes capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, are present in diverse ecological niches and play crucial roles in global carbon and nitrogen cycles. To proliferate in nature, cyanobacteria utilize a host of stress responses to accommodate periodic changes in environmental conditions. A detailed knowledge of the composition of, as well as the dynamic changes in, the proteome is necessary to gain fundamental insights into such stress responses. Toward this goal, we have performed a large-scale proteomic analysis of the widely studied model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 under 33 different environmental conditions. The resulting high-quality dataset consists of 22,318 unique peptides corresponding to 1955 proteins, a coverage of 53% of the predicted proteome. Quantitative determination of protein abundances has led to the identification of 1198 differentially regulated proteins. Notably, our analysis revealed that a common stress response under various environmental perturbations, irrespective of amplitude and duration, is the activation of atypical pathways for the acquisition of carbon and nitrogen from urea and arginine. In particular, arginine is catabolized via putrescine to produce succinate and glutamate, sources of carbon and nitrogen, respectively. This study provides the most comprehensive functional and quantitative analysis of the Synechocystis proteome to date, and shows that a significant stress response of cyanobacteria involves an uncommon mode of acquisition of carbon and nitrogen.\n",

There are nevertheless several inconsistencies and contradictions in the toxin profile of this strain as published by different research groups, and claimed to include carbamoyl (STX, NEO, GTX2/3), decarbamoyl (dcSTX), and N-sulfocarbamoyl (C1/2, B1) derivatives. Our analysis of the complete genome of another PSP toxin-producing cyanobacterium, Raphidiopsis brookii D9, which is closely related to C. raciborskii T3, resolved many issues regarding the correlation between biosynthetic pathways, corresponding genes and the T3 toxin profile. The putative sxt gene cluster in R. brookii D9 has a high synteny with the T3 sxt cluster, with 100% nucleotide identity among the shared genes. We also compared the PSP toxin profile of the strains by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In contrast to published reports, our reassessment of the PSP toxin profile of T3 confirmed production of only STX, NEO and dcNEO. We gained significant insights via correlation between specific sxt genes and their role in PSP toxin synthesis in both D9 and T3 strains. In particular, analysis of sulfotransferase functions for SxtN (N-sulfotransferase) and SxtSUL (O-sulfotransferase) enzymes allowed us to propose an extension of the PSP toxin biosynthetic pathway from STX to the production of the derivatives GTX2/3, C1/2 and B1.

      "Acclimation to high salt concentrations involves concerted changes in gene expression. For the majority of salt-regulated genes, the mechanism underlying the induction process is not known. The gene ggpS (sll1566), which encodes the glucosylglycerol-phosphate synthase responsible for the synthesis of the compatible solute glucosylglycerol (GG), is specifically induced by salt in the cyanobacterial model strain Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. To identify mechanisms mediating this salt-specific gene regulation, the ggpS promoter was analyzed in more detail. 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE) experiments revealed that the adjacent open reading frame (ORF), which is annotated as unknown protein Ssl3076, overlaps with the transcriptional start site of the ggpS gene. Reporter gene expression analyses indicated an essential role for the intact ssl3076 gene in the salt-regulated transcription of a gfp reporter gene. Promoter fragments containing a mutated ssl3076 lost the salt regulation; similarly, a frameshift mutation in ssl3076 resulted in a high level of ggpS expression under low-salt conditions, thereby establishing this small ORF, named ggpR, as a negative regulator of ggpS. Interestingly, small ORFs were also found adjacent to ggpS genes in the genomes of other GG-accumulating cyanobacteria. These results suggest that the GgpR protein represses ggpS expression under low-salt conditions, whereas in salt-shocked and salt-acclimated cells a stress-proportional ggpS expression occurs, leading to GG accumulation.\n",

To further analyze the uncoupling between these two linked processes, we assessed the impact of ammonium ions on the N. spumigena metabolism using a proteomic approach. Proteomic profiling was performed at three different times during ammonium supplementation using quantitative 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by MS/MS analysis. Using this approach, we identified 34 proteins, 28 of which were unique proteins that changed successively in abundance during growth on ammonium. Our results indicate that N. spumigena generally exhibits lower energy production and carbon fixation in the presence of ammonium and seems to be inefficient in utilizing ammonium as an external nitrogen source. The possibility of ammonium toxicity due to PSII damage was investigated and the results are discussed. Our findings have implications in regard to the strategies considered to manage the cyanobacterial blooms in the Baltic Sea.\n",

      "Stress sensors and signal transducers in cyanobacteria.\n",
      "In living cells, the perception of environmental stress and the subsequent transduction of stress signals are primary events in the acclimation to changes in the environment. Some molecular sensors and transducers of environmental stress cannot be identified by traditional and conventional methods. Based on genomic information, a systematic approach has been applied to the solution of this problem in cyanobacteria, involving mutagenesis of potential sensors and signal transducers in combination with DNA microarray analyses for the genome-wide expression of genes. Forty-five genes for the histidine kinases (Hiks), 12 genes for serine-threonine protein kinases (Spks), 42 genes for response regulators (Rres), seven genes for RNA polymerase sigma factors, and nearly 70 genes for transcription factors have been successfully inactivated by targeted mutagenesis in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Screening of mutant libraries by genome-wide DNA microarray analysis under various stress and non-stress conditions has allowed identification of proteins that perceive and transduce signals of environmental stress. Here we summarize recent progress in the identification of sensory and regulatory systems, including Hiks, Rres, Spks, sigma factors, transcription factors, and the role of genomic DNA supercoiling in the regulation of the responses of cyanobacterial cells to various types of stress.\n",

      "Target gene approaches: Gene expression in Daphnia magna exposed to predator-borne kairomones or to microcystin-producing and microcystin-free Microcystis aeruginosa.\n",
      "Two major biological stressors of freshwater zooplankton of the genus Daphnia are predation and fluctuations in food quality. Here we use kairomones released from a planktivorous fish (Leucaspius delineatus) and from an invertebrate predator (larvae of Chaoborus flavicans) to simulate predation pressure; a microcystin-producing culture of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa and a microcystin-deficient mutant are used to investigate effects of low food quality. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) allows quantification of the impact of biotic stressors on differential gene activity. The draft genome sequence for Daphnia pulex facilitates the use of candidate genes by precisely identifying orthologs to functionally characterized genes in other model species. This information is obtained by constructing phylogenetic trees of candidate genes with the knowledge that the Daphnia genome is composed of many expanded gene families.\n",
      "We evaluated seven candidate reference genes for QPCR in Daphnia magna after exposure to kairomones. As a robust approach, a combination normalisation factor (NF) was calculated based on the geometric mean of three of these seven reference genes: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, TATA-box binding protein and succinate dehydrogenase. Using this NF, expression of the target genes actin and alpha-tubulin were revealed to be unchanged in the presence of the tested kairomones. The presence of fish kairomone up-regulated one gene (cyclophilin) involved in the folding of proteins, whereas Chaoborus kairomone down-regulated the same gene.We evaluated the same set of candidate reference genes for QPCR in Daphnia magna after exposure to a microcystin-producing and a microcystin-free strain of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. The NF was calculated based on the reference genes 18S ribosomal RNA, alpha-tubulin and TATA-box binding protein. We found glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme to be up-regulated in the presence of microcystins in the food of D. magna. These findings demonstrate that certain enzymes of glycolysis and protein catabolism are significantly upregulated when daphnids ingest microcystins. Each differentially regulated gene is a member of an expanded gene family in the D. pulex genome. The cyclophilin, GapDH and UBC genes show moderately large sequence divergence from their closest paralogs. Yet actin and alpha-tubulin genes targeted by our study have nearly identical paralogs at the amino acid level.\n",
      "Gene expression analysis using a normalisation factor based on three reference genes showed that transcription levels of actin and alpha-tubulin were not substantially changed by predator-borne chemical cues from fishes or invertebrates, although changes in expression on the protein level were shown elsewhere. These changes in protein level could be caused by others than the investigated paralogs, showing the importance of the construction of phylogenetic trees for candidate gene approaches. However, fish kairomones caused an up-regulation, and Chaoborus kairomone caused a down-regulation of cyclophylin, which proved to be a potential target gene for further analysis of kairomone effects on the life history of daphnids. Changes in food quality required a different set of reference genes compared to the kairomone experiment. The presence of dietary microcystins led to an up-regulation of two genes involved in the basic metabolism of D. magna, i.e. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, which suggests that microcystins in cyanobacteria have more general effects on the metabolism of D. magna than previously thought. Phylogenetic trees resolving relationships among paralogs that share the same gene name are shown to be important for determining the identity of the candidate genes under investigation.\n",

      "Genome mining of mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) synthesizing and non-synthesizing cyanobacteria: A bioinformatics study.\n",
      "Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are a family of more than 20 compounds having absorption maxima between 310 and 362 nm. These compounds are well known for their UV-absorbing/screening role in various organisms and seem to have evolutionary significance. In the present investigation we tested four cyanobacteria, e.g., Anabaena variabilis PCC 7937, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301, for their ability to synthesize MAA and conducted genomic and phylogenetic analysis to identify the possible set of genes that might be involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds. Out of the four investigated species, only A. variabilis PCC 7937 was able to synthesize MAA. Genome mining identified a combination of genes, YP_324358 (predicted DHQ synthase) and YP_324357 (O-methyltransferase), which were present only in A. variabilis PCC 7937 and missing in the other studied cyanobacteria. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these two genes are transferred from a cyanobacterial donor to dinoflagellates and finally to metazoa by a lateral gene transfer event. All other cyanobacteria, which have these two genes, also had another copy of the DHQ synthase gene. The predicted protein structure for YP_324358 also suggested that this product is different from the chemically characterized DHQ synthase of Aspergillus nidulans contrary to the YP_324879, which was predicted to be similar to the DHQ synthase. The present study provides a first insight into the genes of cyanobacteria involved in MAA biosynthesis and thus widens the field of research for molecular, bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis of these evolutionary and industrially important compounds. Based on the results we propose that YP_324358 and YP_324357 gene products are involved in the biosynthesis of the common core (deoxygadusol) of all MAAs.\n",

      "The unique biology of a neoplasm is reflected by its distinct molecular profile compared with normal tissue. To understand tumor development better, we have undertaken a quantitative proteomic search for abnormally expressed proteins in colonic tumors from Apc(Min/+) (Min) mice. By raising pairs of Min and wild-type mice on diets derived from natural-abundance or (15)N-labeled algae, we used metabolic labeling to compare protein levels in colonic tumor versus normal tissue. Because metabolic labeling allows internal control throughout sample preparation and analysis, technical error is minimized as compared with in vitro labeling. Several proteins displayed altered expression, and a subset was validated via stable isotopic dilution using synthetic peptide standards. We also compared gene and protein expression among tumor and nontumor tissue, revealing limited correlation. This divergence was especially pronounced for species showing biological change, highlighting the complementary perspectives provided by transcriptomics and proteomics. Our work demonstrates the power of metabolic labeling combined with stable isotopic dilution as an integrated strategy for the identification and validation of differentially expressed proteins using rodent models of human disease.\n",

      "Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a potentially fatal syndrome associated with the consumption of shellfish that have accumulated saxitoxin (STX). STX is produced by microscopic marine dinoflagellate algae. Little is known about the origin and spread of saxitoxin genes in these under-studied eukaryotes. Fortuitously, some freshwater cyanobacteria also produce STX, providing an ideal model for studying its biosynthesis. Here we focus on saxitoxin-producing cyanobacteria and their non-toxic sisters to elucidate the origin of genes involved in the putative STX biosynthetic pathway.\n",
      "We generated a draft genome assembly of the saxitoxin-producing (STX+) cyanobacterium Anabaena circinalis ACBU02 and searched for 26 candidate saxitoxin-genes (named sxtA to sxtZ) that were recently identified in the toxic strain Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3. We also generated a draft assembly of the non-toxic (STX-) sister Anabaena circinalis ACFR02 to aid the identification of saxitoxin-specific genes. Comparative phylogenomic analyses revealed that nine putative STX genes were horizontally transferred from non-cyanobacterial sources, whereas one key gene (sxtA) originated in STX+ cyanobacteria via two independent horizontal transfers followed by fusion. In total, of the 26 candidate saxitoxin-genes, 13 are of cyanobacterial provenance and are monophyletic among the STX+ taxa, four are shared amongst STX+ and STX-cyanobacteria, and the remaining nine genes are specific to STX+ cyanobacteria.\n",
      "Our results provide evidence that the assembly of STX genes in ACBU02 involved multiple HGT events from different sources followed presumably by coordination of the expression of foreign and native genes in the common ancestor of STX+ cyanobacteria. The ability to produce saxitoxin was subsequently lost multiple independent times resulting in a nested relationship of STX+ and STX- strains among Anabaena circinalis strains.\n",

      "The diversified physiological responses in cyanobacteria under ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation have been broadly researched. The changes in the metabolic control mechanisms hidden behind these physiological traits still need to be further investigated. This research attempts to identify some of the internal mechanisms of several stressful phenotypes such as a decreased growth rate, an impaired photosystem, and the degradation of photosynthetic pigments. Different expression levels of proteins in the cytoplasm of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 under short-term and long-term UV-B stress were investigated by using a comparative proteomic approach. One hundred and twelve differentially expressed protein spots were identified by mass spectrometry to match 75 diverse protein species. They mainly focus on amino acid biosynthesis, photosynthesis and respiration, energy metabolism, protein biosynthesis, cell defence, and other functional groups. By focusing on these areas, the study reveals the correlation between UV-B stress-responsive proteins and the physiological changes listed above. The research, showing that short-term response-proteins are quite different from long-term response-proteins, helps to identify the change in homeostatic mechanisms in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Related putative functions of these proteins and the physiological responses of cyanobacteria under UV-B stress, a UV-B responsive protein network in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 under long-term stress was successfully produced. Such a protein network helps to increase our understanding of the comprehensive functional network cyanobacteria use to adapt to UV-B stress. In addition, 30 novel proteins not previously found related to UV-B stress were identified. This opens up new areas for exploration to identify the response to UV-B stress in cyanobacteria.\n",

      "As a member of an important group of lipid soluble antioxidants, tocopherols play a paramount role in the daily diet of humans and animals. Recently, genes required for tocochromanol biosynthesis pathway have been identified and cloned with the help of genomics-based approaches and molecular manipulation in the model organisms: Arabidopsis thaliana and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. At the basis of these foundations, genetic manipulation of tocochromanol biosynthesis pathway can give rise to strategies that enhance the level of tocochromanol content or convert the constitution of tocochromanol. In addition, genetic manipulations of the tocochromanol biosynthesis pathway provide help for the study of the function of tocopherol in plant systems. The present article summarizes recent advances and pays special attention to the functions of tocopherol in plants. The roles of tocopherol in the network of reactive oxygen species, antioxidants and phytohormones to maintain redox homeostasis and the functions of tocopherol as a signal molecule in chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling to regulate carbohydrate metabolism are also discussed.\n",

      "We describe a novel, typically prokaryotic, sensor kinase in chloroplasts of green plants. The gene for this chloroplast sensor kinase (CSK) is found in cyanobacteria, prokaryotes from which chloroplasts evolved. The CSK gene has moved, during evolution, from the ancestral chloroplast to the nuclear genomes of eukaryotic algae and green plants. The CSK protein is now synthesised in the cytosol of photosynthetic eukaryotes and imported into their chloroplasts as a protein precursor. In the model higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana, CSK is autophosphorylated and required for control of transcription of chloroplast genes by the redox state of an electron carrier connecting photosystems I and II. CSK therefore provides a redox regulatory mechanism that couples photosynthesis to gene expression. This mechanism is inherited directly from the cyanobacterial ancestor of chloroplasts, is intrinsic to chloroplasts, and is targeted to chloroplast genes.\n",

      "Blooms that are formed by cyanobacteria consist of toxic and nontoxic strains. The mechanisms that result in the occurrence of nontoxic strains are enigmatic. All the nontoxic strains of the filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix that were isolated from 9 European countries were found to have lost 90% of a large microcystin synthetase (mcy) gene cluster that encoded the synthesis of the toxic peptide microcystin (MC). Those strains still contain the flanking regions of the mcy gene cluster along with remnants of the transposable elements that are found in between. The majority of the strains still contain a gene coding for a distinct thioesterase type II (mcyT), which is putatively involved in MC synthesis. The insertional inactivation of mcyT in an MC-producing strain resulted in the reduction of MC synthesis by 94 +/- 2% (1 standard deviation). Nontoxic strains that occur in shallow lakes throughout Europe form a monophyletic lineage. A second lineage consists of strains that contain the mcy gene cluster but differ in their photosynthetic pigment composition, which is due to the occurrence of strains that contain phycocyanin or large amounts of phycoerythrin in addition to phycocyanin. Strains containing phycoerythrin typically occur in deep-stratified lakes. The rare occurrence of gene cluster deletion, paired with the evolutionary diversification of the lineages of strains that lost or still contain the mcy gene cluster, needs to be invoked in order to explain the absence or dominance of toxic cyanobacteria in various habitats.\n",

      "Global quantitative analysis of protein phosphorylation status in fish exposed to microcystin.\n",
      "The hepatotoxins, microcystins (MCs) are potent inhibitors of protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. These nonribosomal peptides are getting more and more attention because of their acute toxicity and potent tumor-promoting activity. These toxins are produced by freshwater cyanobacteria. Herein, we report a toxicological study conducted on aquatic animal models such as the medaka fish. To date, the detailed mechanisms underlying the toxicity of microcystins are unknown. MC-leucine-arginine (MC-LR) is the most toxic and the most commonly encountered variant of MCs in aquatic environment. It has been used for toxicological investigations on the liver of intoxicated medaka. We performed differential proteome analyses of MC-LR-treated and untreated medaka fish to investigate the mechanisms of establishment of early responses to the toxin. The identification of proteins involved in these early responses might constitute candidates of biomarkers of MC-LR exposure. Cytosolic proteins from livers of exposed or nonexposed medaka were resolved by 2D electrophoresis and detected using stains specific for phosphoproteins and for whole protein content. Overall, 15 spots were found to vary significantly on the proteomic 2D maps or on the phosphoproteomic 2D maps. Of these 15 proteins, only two could not be identified by mass spectrometry. Among the other proteins that were identified, phenylalanine hydroxylase and keratin 18 (type I) showed variations in phoshoryl content in agreement with inhibition of PP2A activity after exposure of the fish to MC-LR. The other identified proteins exhibited variations in their expression level. The identified proteins appear to be involved in cytoskeleton assembly, cell signalling, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. The functional implications of responses to MC-LR exposure of these proteins are discussed. The methodology described in this report should be widely used to a number of tissues and organisms, thus helping in the search for biomarkers of MC-LR contamination.\n",

The possible involvement of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in cylindrospermopsin-induced gene expression was examined in cultured human dermal fibroblasts and the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. After 6 h of exposure to CYN, concentration-dependent increases in mRNA levels were observed for the p53 target genes CDKN1A, GADD45alpha, BAX, and MDM2, indicating an early activation of p53. After 24 h, relative mRNA levels for these genes remained elevated. Accumulation of p53 protein occurred after longer exposures in the HepG2-derived cell line C3A.

      "Roots display hydrotropism in response to moisture gradients, which is thought to be important for controlling their growth orientation, obtaining water, and establishing their stand in the terrestrial environment. However, the molecular mechanism underlying hydrotropism remains unknown. Here, we report that roots of the Arabidopsis mutant mizu-kussei1 (miz1), which are impaired in hydrotropism, show normal gravitropism and elongation growth. The roots of miz1 plants showed reduced phototropism and a modified wavy growth response. There were no distinct differences in morphological features and root structure between miz1 and wild-type plants. These results suggest that the pathway inducing hydrotropism is independent of the pathways used in other tropic responses. The phenotype results from a single recessive mutation in MIZ1, which encodes a protein containing a domain (the MIZ domain) that is highly conserved among terrestrial plants such as rice and moss. The MIZ domain was not found in known genomes of organisms such as green algae, red algae, cyanobacteria, or animals. We hypothesize that MIZ1 has evolved to play an important role in adaptation to terrestrial life because hydrotropism could contribute to drought avoidance in higher plants. In addition, a pMIZ1::GUS fusion gene was expressed strongly in columella cells of the root cap but not in the elongation zone, suggesting that MIZ1 functions in the early phase of the hydrotropic response.\n",

Our systematic screening of a library of mutant lines with defects in histidine kinases (Hiks) by RNA slot-blot hybridization and DNA-microarray analysis suggested that four Hiks, namely, Hik33, Hik34, Hik16 and Hik41, are involved in the perception and transduction of H(2)O(2) signals that regulate the gene expression of 26 of the 77 H(2)O(2)-inducible genes with induction factors higher than 4.0. Among the four Hiks, Hik33 was the main contributor and was responsible for 22 of the 26 H(2)O(2)-inducible genes under the control of the Hiks.

      "Nitrate transport activity of the LtnT permease of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus is activated when LtnA, a response regulator without an effector domain, is phosphorylated by LtnB, a hybrid histidine kinase. We identified a protein (LtnC) that is required for activation of LtnT. LtnC consists of an N-terminal histidine-containing phosphoacceptor (HisKA) domain, a receiver domain, and a unique C-terminal domain found in some cyanobacterial proteins. Because LtnC lacks an ATP-binding kinase domain of a histidine kinase, it is incapable of autophosphorylation, but LtnC is phosphorylated by LtnA. The histidine residue in the HisKA domain but not the aspartate residue in the receiver domain is essential for phosphorylation of LtnC and activation of LtnT. LtnC phosphorylation leads to oligomerization of the protein. Fusion of the C-terminal domain of LtnC to glutathione S-transferase, which forms oligomers, also activates LtnT, suggesting that oligomerization of the LtnC C-terminal domain causes LtnT activation. These results indicate that the C-terminal domain of LtnC acts as an effector domain that directs the output of the signal from the phosphorelay system. The two-step (His-Asp-His) phosphorelay system, composed of the LtnB, LtnA, and LtnC proteins, is distinct from the known phosphorelay systems, namely, the typical two-component system (His-Asp) and the multistep phosphorelay system (His-Asp-His-Asp), because the HisKA domain of LtnC is the terminal phosphoacceptor that determines the signal output. LtnC is a new class of signal transducer in His-Asp phosphorelay systems that contains a HisKA domain and an effector domain.\n",

Potential MC-producing Microcystis, Planktothrixand Anabaena spp. existed in 70%, 63%, and 37% of the lake samples, respectively. Approximately two-thirds of the lake samples contained one or two potential MC producers, while all three genera existed in 24% of the samples. In oligotrophic lakes, the occurrence of only one MC producer was most common. The combination of Microcystis and Planktothrix was slightly more prevalent than others in mesotrophic lakes, and the cooccurrence of all three MC producers was most widespread in both eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes. The proportion of the three-producer lakes increased with the trophic status of the lakes. In correlation analysis, the presence of multiple MC-producing genera was associated with higher cyanobacterial and phytoplankton biomass, pH, chlorophyll a, total nitrogen, and MC concentrations. Total nitrogen, pH, and the surface area of the lake predicted the occurrence probability of mcyE genes, whereas total phosphorus alone accounted for MC concentrations in the samples by logistic and linear regression analyses. In conclusion, the results suggested that eutrophication increased the cooccurrence of potentially MC-producing cyanobacterial genera, raising the risk of toxic-bloom formation.\n",

The main damage to DNA produced by UV radiation is known to be the formation of pyrimidine photoproducts: it is estimated that about 10 dimers per minute are formed in an Escherichia coli chromosome exposed to the UV light in direct overhead sunlight at sea level. It is also known that on an E. coli chromosome exposed to UVb wavelengths (290-320 nm), pyrimidine photoproducts are formed in the following proportions: 59% TpT, 7% CpC, and 34% CpT plus TpC. We have analyzed all available complete prokaryotic genomes and the model organism Prochlorococcus marinus and have found that pyrimidine dinucleotides are not systematically avoided. This suggests that prokaryotes must have sufficiently effective protection and repair systems for UV exposure to not affect their dinucleotide composition.\n",

Approximately 9% of the genes in wild type and DeltasigB were significantly regulated (P < 0.001) following this treatment, with chaperones induced the most. The absence of sigB had no dramatic effect on specific genes induced by heat shock, but did affect the level of transcription of the chaperones. In addition, sigE was induced in DeltasigB. Comparison of global gene expression of the wild type and the hrcA mutant at 30 degrees C enabled us to examine the HrcA regulon, which included groESL and groEL2. Several genes belonging to specific functional groups (e.g., pilus biogenesis/assembly and phototaxis, biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, murien sacculus and peptidoglycan, surface polysaccharides, and the Sec pathway) were differentially regulated following heat shock. We used results from knock-out mutants in sigB, sigD and sigE to construct a model of the network of group 2 sigma factor regulation upon each other.

      "UV irradiation and desiccation modulate the three-dimensional extracellular matrix of Nostoc commune (Cyanobacteria).\n",
      "Cyanobacterium Nostoc commune can tolerate the simultaneous stresses of desiccation, UV irradiation, and oxidation. Acidic WspA, of approximately 33.6 kDa, is secreted to the three-dimensional extracellular matrix and accounts for greater than 70% of the total soluble protein. The wspA gene of N. commune strain DRH1 was cloned and found in a single genomic copy, in a monocistronic operon. Transcription of wspA and sodF (superoxide dismutase), and synthesis and secretion of WspA, were induced upon desiccation or UV-A/B irradiation of cells. Recombinant WspA binds the UV-A/B absorbing pigment scytonemin through non-covalent interactions. WspA peptide polymorphism, and heterogeneity of multiple wspA sequences within cells of a single colony, account for distinct WspA isoforms. WspA has no similarity to entries in the sequence databases and wspA, a possible xenolog, is restricted to a subset of strains in the \"form species\" N. commune characterized through group I intron phylogeny. We hypothesize that WspA plays a central role in the global stress response of N. commune through modulation of the structure and function of the three-dimensional extracellular matrix, particularly the transport, distribution, and/or macromolecular architecture of mycosporine and scytonemin UV-A/B absorbing pigment complexes.\n",

      "Return of the cycad hypothesis - does the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism dementia complex (ALS/PDC) of Guam have new implications for global health?\n",
      "Recently published work provides evidence in support of the cycad hypothesis for Lytico--Bodig, the Guamanian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism dementia complex (ALS/PDC), based on a new understanding of Chamorro food practices, a cyanobacterial origin of beta-methylaminoalanine (BMAA) in cycad tissue, and a possible mechanism of biomagnification of this neurotoxic amino acid in the food chain. BMAA is one of two cycad chemicals with known neurotoxic properties (the other is cycasin, a proven developmental neurotoxin) among the many substances that exist in these highly poisonous plants, the seeds of which are used by Chamorros for food and medicine. The traditional diet includes the fruit bat, a species that feeds on cycad seed components and reportedly bioaccumulates BMAA. Plant and animal proteins provide a previously unrecognized reservoir for the slow release of this toxin. BMAA is reported in the brain tissue of Guam patients and early data suggest that some Northern American patients dying of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have detectable brain levels of BMAA. The possible role of cyanobacterial toxicity in sporadic neurodegenerative disease is therefore worthy of consideration. Recent neuropathology studies of ALS/PDC confirm understanding of this disorder as a 'tangle' disease, based on variable anatomical burden, and showing biochemical characteristics of 'AD-like' combined 3R and 4R tau species. This model mirrors the emerging view that other neurodegenerative disease spectra comprise clusters of related syndromes, owing to common molecular pathology, with variable anatomical distribution in the nervous system giving rise to different clinical phenotypes. Evidence for 'ubiquitin-only' inclusions in ALS/PDC is weak. Similarly, although there is evidence for alpha-synucleinopathy in ALS/PDC, the parkinsonian component of the disease is not caused by Lewy body disease. The spectrum of sporadic AD includes involvement of the substantia nigra and a high prevalence of 'incidental'alpha-synucleinopathy in sporadic AD is reported. Therefore the pathogenesis of Lytico-Bodig appears still to have most pertinence to the ongoing investigation of the pathogenesis of AD and other tauopathies.\n",

      "Identical Hik-Rre systems are involved in perception and transduction of salt signals and hyperosmotic signals but regulate the expression of individual genes to different extents in synechocystis.\n",
      "In previous studies, we characterized five histidine kinases (Hiks) and the cognate response regulators (Rres) that control the expression of approximately 70% of the hyperosmotic stress-inducible genes in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In the present study, we screened a gene knock-out library of Rres by RNA slot-blot hybridization and with a genome-wide DNA microarray and identified three Hik-Rre systems, namely, Hik33-Rre31, Hik10-Rre3, and Hik16-Hik41-Rre17, as well as another system that included Rre1, that were involved in perception of salt stress and transduction of the signal. We found that these Hik-Rre systems were identical to those that were involved in perception and transduction of the hyperosmotic stress signal. We compared the induction factors of the salt stress- and hyperosmotic stress-inducible genes that are located downstream of each system and found that these genes responded to the two kinds of stress to different respective extents. In addition, the Hik33-Rre31 system regulated the expression of genes that were specifically induced by hyperosmotic stress, whereas the system that included Rre1 regulated the expression of one or two genes that were specifically induced either by salt stress or by hyperosmotic stress. Our observations suggest that the perception of salt and hyperosmotic stress by the Hik-Rre systems is complex and that salt stress and hyperosmotic stress are perceived as distinct signals by the Hik-Rre systems.\n",

      "Microorganisms respond to hyperosmotic stress via changes in the levels of expression of large numbers of genes. Such responses are essential for acclimation to a new osmotic environment. To identify factors involved in the perception and transduction of signals caused by hyperosmotic stress, we examined the response of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which has proven to be a particularly useful microorganism in similar analyses. We screened knockout libraries of histidine kinases (Hiks) and response regulators (Rres) in Synechocystis by DNA microarray and slot-blot hybridization analyses, and we identified several two-component systems, which we designated Hik-Rre systems, namely, Hik33-Rre31, Hik34-Rre1, and Hik10-Rre3, as well as Hik16-Hik41-Rre17, as the transducers of hyperosmotic stress. We also identified Hik2-Rre1 as a putative additional two-component system. Each individual two-component system regulated the transcription of a specific group of genes that were responsive to hyperosmotic stress.\n",

      "Evidence for recombination in the microcystin synthetase (mcy) genes of toxic cyanobacteria Microcystis spp.\n",
      "Recombination has been suggested to be an important factor for the genetic variation of bacterial genes, but few studies have dealt with intragenic recombination between the same or closely related species of cyanobacteria. Here we provide strong evidence for recombination in the microcystin synthetase (mcy) gene cluster of the toxic cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. This gene cluster contains 10 genes (mcyA to J) that encode a mixed polyketide synthase (PKS)/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) complex. mcy gene sequences were determined for four selected regions (within mcyA, D, G, and J) within the mcy gene cluster from 1 Canadian and 10 Asian toxic Microcystis and compared with previously published mcy sequences. Split decomposition analysis indicated a reticulate phylogeny of mcyA, and several potential recombination tracts of mcyA were identified by the RDP analysis and a runs test implemented in GENECONV. In contrast, no recombination was detected in the mcyD, G, and J sequences. However, discrepancies among the four mcy gene genealogies were evident from the results of independent split decomposition analyses, which were further supported by incongruence length difference (ILD) tests. Taken together, these findings suggest that both intragenic and intergenic recombination within the mcy gene cluster contributes to the genetic diversity of the mcy genes of Microcystis spp.\n",

      "Enhanced photosynthesis and redox energy production contribute to salinity tolerance in Dunaliella as revealed by homology-based proteomics.\n",
      "Salinity is a major limiting factor for the proliferation of plants and inhibits central metabolic activities such as photosynthesis. The halotolerant green alga Dunaliella can adapt to hypersaline environments and is considered a model photosynthetic organism for salinity tolerance. To clarify the molecular basis for salinity tolerance, a proteomic approach has been applied for identification of salt-induced proteins in Dunaliella. Seventy-six salt-induced proteins were selected from two-dimensional gel separations of different subcellular fractions and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). Application of nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry, combined with sequence-similarity database-searching algorithms, MS BLAST and MultiTag, enabled identification of 80% of the salt-induced proteins. Salinity stress up-regulated key enzymes in the Calvin cycle, starch mobilization, and redox energy production; regulatory factors in protein biosynthesis and degradation; and a homolog of a bacterial Na(+)-redox transporters. The results indicate that Dunaliella responds to high salinity by enhancement of photosynthetic CO(2) assimilation and by diversion of carbon and energy resources for synthesis of glycerol, the osmotic element in Dunaliella. The ability of Dunaliella to enhance photosynthetic activity at high salinity is remarkable because, in most plants and cyanobacteria, salt stress inhibits photosynthesis. The results demonstrated the power of MS BLAST searches for the identification of proteins in organisms whose genomes are not known and paved the way for dissecting molecular mechanisms of salinity tolerance in algae and higher plants.\n",

      "Recently, the temporal response of genes to changes in their environment has been investigated using cDNA microarray technology by measuring the gene expression levels at a small number of time points. Conventional techniques for time series analysis are not suitable for such a short series of time-ordered data. The analysis of gene expression data has therefore usually been limited to a fold-change analysis, instead of a systematic statistical approach.\n",

      "Salt-dependent expression of glucosylglycerol-phosphate synthase, involved in osmolyte synthesis in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803.\n",
      "The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 is able to acclimate to levels of salinity ranging from freshwater to twice the seawater concentrations of salt by accumulating the compatible solute glucosylglycerol (GG). Expression of the ggpS gene coding for the key enzyme (glucosylglycerol-phosphate synthase) in GG synthesis was examined in detail. Under control conditions, the GgpS protein is stable, so that weak constitutive transcription of the ggpS gene resulted in a significant protein content. However, the enzyme activity was biochemically switched off, and no GG was detectable. After a salt shock, an immediate increase in mRNA content proportional to the salt content occurred, while the GgpS protein and GG contents rose in a linear manner. Furthermore, the stability of the ggpS mRNA increased transiently. In salt-acclimated cells expression of the ggpS gene, the GgpS protein content, and the amount of accumulated GG depended linearly on the external salt concentration. Mapping of the 5' end of the ggpS transcript revealed a long nontranslated 5' sequence and a putative typical cyanobacterial promoter, which did not show any obvious salt-regulatory element. The alternative sigma factor sigma(F) was found to be involved in salt-dependent regulation of ggpS, since in a sigma(F) mutant induction of this gene was strongly reduced. The present study demonstrated that in addition to biochemical regulation of GgpS activity, alterations of ggpS expression are involved in regulation of GG synthesis in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. A model showing the interaction of the two regulatory levels is presented.\n",

      "Bacterial signalling involving eukaryotic-type protein kinases.\n",
      "Protein Ser, Thr and Tyr kinases play essential roles in signal transduction in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals, where they regulate a variety of cellular activities. During the last few years, a number of genes that encode eukaryotic-type protein kinases have also been identified in four different bacterial species, suggesting that such enzymes are also widespread in prokaryotes. Although many of them have yet to be fully characterized, several studies indicate that eukaryotic-type protein kinases play important roles in regulating cellular activities of these bacteria, such as cell differentiation, pathogenicity and secondary metabolism. A model based on the possible coupling between two-component systems and eukaryotic-type protein kinases is proposed to explain the function of eukaryotic-type protein kinases in bacterial signalling in the light of studies in bacteria, as well as in plants and yeast. These two groups of eukaryotes possess signal-transduction pathways involving both two-component systems and eukaryotic protein kinases.\n",
